\begin{abstract}
A key difficulty in verifying shared-memory concurrent programs is
reasoning compositionally about each thread in isolation. Existing
verification techniques for fine-grained concurrency typically require
reasoning about either the entire shared state  or disjoint
parts of the shared state,  impeding compositionality.  This paper introduces
the program logic \colosl, where each thread is verified with respect
to its subjective view of the global shared state.  This subjective
view describes only that part of the state  accessed
by the thread. Subjective views may arbitrarily overlap with each
other, and expand and contract depending on the resource required by
the thread.  This flexibility gives rise to small specifications and,
hence,  more compositional reasoning for concurrent programs. We
demonstrate our reasoning on 
a range of examples,  including a concurrent
computation of a spanning tree of a graph.
