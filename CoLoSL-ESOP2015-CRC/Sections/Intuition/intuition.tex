\section{Informal Development}
\label{sec:intuition}

We illustrate our \colosl reasoning principles by sketching a proof of
a variation of Dijkstra's token-ring mutual exclusion
algorithm~\cite{dijkstra74}. 

Dijkstra introduced the notion of \emph{self-stabilising} distributed algorithms in~\cite{dijkstra74}. A distributed algorithm is self-stabilising if starting from any arbitrary state, it converges to a legitimate state and remains so thereafter. Moreover, the ``current state" is not stored in a central location accessible by all machines, rather it is recorded in variables distributed over several machines.
 
In~\cite{dijkstra74} Dijkstra presented the token ring algorithm - a network of $n$ machines arranged in a ring with a designated \emph{master} machine (numbered $1$) and $n-1$ slave machines (numbered $2 \cdots n$). Each machine maintains a local counter which constitute the current state of the system. 
%and the current state of the system consists of the $n$ counters. 
In addition, each machine (numbered $i$) can communicate with the previous machine in the ring (numbered $i-1$ when $i>1$; or $n$ when $i=1$) and enquire about the value of its counter.
%
 A legitimate state of the network is one in which exactly one machine holds a ``token" at any given time. The $k$th machine holds a token if there exists a value $v \in \Nats$ such that value of all counters numbered $1\cdots k-1$ is $v+1$ and the value of those numbered $k\cdots n$ is $v$ (note that the master machine holds a token when all counters hold value $v$). The $k$th machine holding a token can then increment its counter and effectively pass the token to the machine next in the ring.
 
 The token ring algorithm is self-stabilising: starting from an arbitrary (illegitimate) state where counters are initialised with random values within a given range, the system converges to a legitimate state in a finite number of steps. In~\cite{dijkstra-proof}, Dijkstra provided a proof of the token ring's self-stabilisation. In~\cite{colosl-tr14}, we outline a proof sketch of self-stabilisation in \colosl and demonstrate that starting from an arbitrary state the system converges to a legitimate state.
 
Since once in a legitimate state, 1) the system remains so thereafter; and 2) exactly one machine holds a token at any given time, one can use the token ring as a mutual exclusion mechanism to synchronise access to shared resources. We demonstrate this in~\cite{colosl-tr14} by using the token ring to control access to a simple shared resource $\cell{t}{v}$ (e.g. pointing to the top of a shared stack). 

In the remainder of this section, we illustrate the \colosl reasoning principles through a token ring in a legitimate state where the master thread holds a token and all counters hold value $0$.  The \colosl reasoning principles are laid out in \fig\ref{fig:principles}, together with the usual concurrency rule of separation logic~\cite{csl-tcs}, and the rule of consequence from the Views framework~\cite{views}.  We will introduce them informally as needed, and present them in more details in \S\ref{sec:colosl}.

\colosl introduces a new assertion $\shared{P} I$ called a
\emph{subjective view}, which comprises an assertion $P$ describing
\emph{parts} of the global shared state and an interference assertion
$I$ which characterises how this partial shared state may be changed
by the thread or the environment. Similar to interference assertions
of CAP, $I$ declares transitions of the form $[\token a] : Q \swap R$,
where a thread in possession of the $[\token a]$ capability (in its
private state) may carry out its transition and update parts of the
shared state that satisfy $Q$ to those described by $R$. Assertions in
Hoare triples must be {\em stable}; that is, robust with respect to
interferences from the environment (as prescribed in the interference
relations attached to that assertion's subjective views). The $*$
(resp.\ $**$) connective is that of separation logic and means that
the current state is a disjoint (resp.\ potentially overlapping)
composition of two states satisfying each sub-formula. The overlapping
conjunction $**$ has been used in the past to reason about sharing in
data structures~\cite{rey-slnotes,js-popl12,ramification}. The
\emph{view shift}~\cite{views} (or
\emph{repartitioning}~\cite{cap-ecoop10}) $P ===> Q$ means that an
(instrumented) state satisfying $P$ may be manipulated without
changing the machine states it denotes. In particular, $(P => Q) => (P
===> Q)$.

Consider the program $\mathbb{INC}$ defined in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}, ignoring the
assertions. It is written in pseudo-code resembling C with additional
constructs for concurrency: atomic sections $\atomic \_$ which
declare that code behaves atomically; and
parallel composition $\_ ||\_ $  which spawns threads then waits until
they complete. In our example, after
initialisation of the variables to $0$, three threads are spawned to
increment each variable in a lock-step fashion: $\mathbb{P}_{\li x}$
is the first allowed to run its increment operation; then
$\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$; and finally $\mathbb{P}_{\li z}$. This process
repeats until $\li{x} = \li{y} = \li{z} = 10$.  This example code is
interesting because the threads are intricately intertwined. In the case of the $\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$ thread, the programmer knows that the code depends on the values of variables
\li{x} and \li{y}  and that it can increment  \li{y} as long as its value is less than that of \li{x}.
However, she also knows a much more complex behaviour of the thread: given the initial setting where all variables have value $0$, then the thread can only increase the value of \li{y} by $1$ if \li{x} is one more than \li{y},  and the environment can only increase \li{x} by one if \li{x} and \li{z} (and in fact \li{y}) have the same value. Finally, the programmer knows that at the end all the variables will have value $10$. 

\colosl can simply specify this complex behaviour of the resources
associated with thread $\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$.  Consider the \colosl
assertions accompanying $\mathbb{INC}$.  After initialisation, line~3
of $\mathbb{INC}$ provides a standard assertion from separation
logic~\cite{seplog} with variables as
resource~\cite{variablesAsResource}. The assertion declares that the
variable cells addressed by \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} have value
$0$. This variable resource in the thread-local state is fully owned
by the thread. Using the \extendRule principle in conjunction with the
\conseqRule rule, the thread is able to give up this local resource
and transfer it to the global shared state.

In its general form, the \extendRule adds locally-held resources
described by $P$ to the shared state, subject to the new interference
relation $I$, and creates fresh sets of tokens $\token A$, $\token A'$, some
kept locally and some shared. The side-condition $P\containI I$
ensures that $I$ cannot modify resource outside of the new extension
delimited by $P$, in particular preserving any pre-existing subjective
view of the shared state which otherwise would need to suddenly
account for new interference in $I$. As will be crucial for the set
example in \S\ref{sec:examples} (but unimportant here), a novel
feature of this rule is that actions in $I$ may refer to existing
shared resources, unlike CAP for example, where all possible futures of the
region must be accounted for upon its creation. 

Line~4 demonstrates the creation of a subjective view
$\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|-> 0 * \li{z}|-> 0}I$ under
interferences coming from three similar actions. For instance, $a_{\li
  y}$ can increment \li{y} under the condition that its value is one
less than \li{x}.  This update can only be carried out by the thread
that holds the $[\token a_{\li y}]$ \emph{capability} in its local
state. For this particular example, the assertion in line~4 simply has
all the capabilities $[\token a_{\li x}] * [\token a_{\li y}] *
[\token a_{\li z}]$ of the actions of $I$ in the local state; in
general, capabilities can be buried inside boxes, only to emerge as a
consequence of an action (see \S\ref{sec:examples}).

This subjective view may then be freely duplicated using the \copyRule
principle and each thread is given a copy together with the
appropriate capability using the \parRule rule. For instance, thread
$\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$ gets
$
\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{I} *[\token a_{\li y}]
$.

However, this precondition is more complicated than we
need. Intuitively, the specification of each thread should only use
the variable resource relevant to that thread, and need only consider
actions that affect that resource. In this example, the extraneous
piece of state is the variable cell \li{z}. This additional resource
might seem an acceptable price to pay, but straightforward
generalisations to $n$ participants yields extra state of $n\!-\!2$
variable cells with their associated interferences which are of no
interest to the particular thread.  Fundamentally, for large systems,
the burden of carrying the whole shared state around to analyse all
threads can lead to intractable proofs. In our example this would be
acceptable since the footprint of each thread is small, but in general needlessly
verbose states require extraneous stability checks at every program
point.

Because subjective views only describe \emph{parts} of the shared
state, we can use the \forgetRule principle to obtain a weaker view of
the shared state, in this case a view that ignores \li{z}. The resulting subjective view is
not necessarily stable any longer; here we weaken it to regain
stability:
%%  The \shiftRule principle allows
%% us to replace $I$ with any interference relation $I'$ that has the
%% same observable effect on the subjective assertion $P$ (written $I
%% \weakenI{P} I'$). Without the \li{z} cell, action $a_{\li z}$ does not
%% have observable effects since it leaves other cells unchanged. We thus
%% get:
\begin{align*}
 	\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{I} *[\token a_{\li y}]&
	\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>} \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0}{I} *[\token a_{\li y} ]\\
 	%% &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{\semimplies}
        %% \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{I\setminus a_{\small\li z}} *[\token a_{\li y}]\\
	&\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>}
        \shared{\exsts{v, v'}  (\li{x}|-> v \!*\! \li{y}|->v' ) \!\land\! v\geq v'}{I} \!\!*[\token a_{\li y}]
\end{align*}
%Since the thread owns $[\token{a}_{\li{y}}]$ locally, the environment can't perform its action and thus the subjective view is stable against it. On the other hand, as the environment may hold $[\token{a}_{\li{x}}]$, we should stabilise with respect to its action. 
However, this assertion is now too weak for our purposes. Indeed, the
programmer knows that \li{x} can only be incremented when its value is
equal to \li{z} and \li{y}. However, this is not reflected in
$a_{\small\li{x}}$. Since we have forgotten the value of \li{z}, it
could match the value of \li{x} whenever \li{x} is incremented by
$a_{\small\li{x}}$, hence there is nothing to constrain the increment
on \li{x} given the values of \li{x} and \li{y}. We can thus only
stabilise to a weak assertion that loses information about how the
values of \li{x} and \li{y} are connected together through \li{z}.
%
It is however possible to give a stronger specification, as follows: \vspace*{-8pt} 
%
\begin{align*}
  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{I} *[\token a_{\small\li y}]
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{\{a_{\small\li x}', a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li z}\}} *[\token a_{\small\li y} ] \vspace*{-5pt}\\
  &\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{\{a_{\small\li x}', a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li z}\}} *[\token a_{\small\li y}]\\
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{I_{\small\li y}'} *[\token a_{\small\li y}] \\
  &\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>}
  \shared{
    \begin{array}{@{}l<{\null}@{}l<{\null}@{}}
      \cell{\li{x}}{0} * \cell{\li{y}}{0} |/ 
      \cell{\li{x}}{1} * \cell{\li{y}}{0}
    \end{array}
  }{I_{\small\li y}'}
  * [\token a_{\small\li y}]\vspace*{-5pt}
\end{align*}
%
This implication involves subtle interaction between the assertion and
the interference relation of the subjective view.  Consider the $a_{\small\li x}$ action and the initial state with value $0$ in all the
cells. This action can be replaced by $a_{\small\li x}'$ because, as the
programmer knows, whenever \li{x} and \li{z} have the same value then
\li{y} also has the same value which, under these conditions, is not
changed by the actions in $I$.  This amended action reflects stronger
knowledge about when \li{x} can be incremented and how its value is
related to \li{y} and \li{z}.
%This amended action gives full information about how the resource of the subjective view changes as \li{x} is being updated.
\shiftRule allows us to replace $I$ with any interference relation
$I'$ that has the same observable effect as far as the subjective
assertion $P$ of the subjective view is concerned (written $I
\weakenI{P} I'$). By the informal argument above,
$I\weakenI{\cell{\li{x}}{0} * \cell{\li{y}}{0} * \cell{\li{z}}{0}}
\{a'_{\small\li x}, a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li z}\}$, hence we can
replace $I$ with $\{a'_{\small\li x}, a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li
  z}\}$.
%%
%\[
%I\weakenIb{\cell{\li{x}}{0} * \cell{\li{y}}{0} * \cell{\li{z}}{0}} I_{\small\li y}
%\]
%%
Only then do we use \forgetRule to lose \li{z} and obtain the
subjective view  $\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{I_{\small\li
    y}'}$, as the new action $a_{\small\li x}'$ in $I'_{\small\li y}$
retains enough information about how \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} are
related. Without \li{z}, the action $a_{\li z}$ does not
have observable effects since it leaves other cells unchanged, hence 
another application of \shiftRule rids us of $a_{\small\li{z}}$.
The interference relation is now as simple as it can get, whilst retaining enough information about the connection between \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z}. Finally, we stabilise the subjective view with respect to $I_{\small\li y}'$ and obtain our final precondition of $\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$.
%, which retains much more information about the values of \li{x} and \li{y}. %

%% There is one more subtlety to mention about this precondition. The thread has the capability $[\token a_{\small\li y}]$ to perform its action which only requires the resources described by the subjective view. However, the action $a_{\small\li x}$ depends on \li{z}, which is no longer a part of the subjective view of the thread. Since another thread in the environment may own the $[\token{a_{\small\li x}}]$ capability, it may perform its action whenever its subjective view is {\em compatible} with the pre-condition of the action.
%% When that is the case, the piece of the state corresponding to the overlap between the state and the
%% precondition of the action is removed, and the entire postcondition of the action is added in its place.
%% %Diagrammatically, a subjective state (represented by the circle) is affected as follows by an action $P\swap Q$:\vspace*{-8pt}

%% %%
%% This is due to the fact that the subjective view describes the thread's partial knowledge about the shared state, while the environment may have some additional knowledge to what the thread knows. In this case, while the thread does not have the capability to do the action of $[\token a_{\small\li x}]$, the environment might.

The proof of the specification of the thread $\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$ is
now relatively straightforward. By inspection (or using the rules of
\S\ref{subsec:prules}), the invariant of the while loop is stable with
respect to $I_{\small\li y}'$. The atomic section allows safe manipulation
of the contents of the subjective view.  The final postcondition of
$\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$ follows from the invariant and the boolean
expression of the while. We join up the postconditions of the threads
using \mergeRule, which embodies a crucial feature of \colosl:
different subjective views \emph{overlap}. Since $|/$ distributes over
$**$, the subjective view simplifies to $\shared{\li{x}|->10 *
  \li{y}|->10 * \li{z}|->10}{I_{\small\li x}'\cup I_{\small\li y}'\cup I_{\small\li z}'}
$.  Finally, since $ I_{\small\li x}'\cup I_{\small\li y}'\cup I_{\small\li z}'$
$\weakenI{\li{x}|->10 * \li{y}|->10 * \li{z}|->10} I $, by the
\shiftRule principle, we get the postcondition of $\mathbb{INC}$.


%\paragraph{Comparison with other formalisms}
This concludes our \colosl proof of $\mathbb{INC}$. Our expansion and
contraction of subjective views, in particular with shifting of
interference assertions in key places, enables us to confine the
specification and verification of each thread to just the resources
they need. This is not possible in existing frameworks.


We complete our semi-formal overview by noting that unlike
CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and as in iCAP~\cite{icap}, we do not provide
an explicit \emph{unsharing} mechanism to claim shared
resources and render them thread-local. Instead, this behaviour can
be simply encoded as an additional action. For instance, in order to
remove the \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} variables from the shared state
at the end of the $\mathbb{INC}$ program, one can add the following
action to all of the above interference assertions ($I$,
$I_{\small\li{x}}'$,
$I_{\small\li{y}}'$, and $I_{\small\li{z}}'$):
%
\vspace{-5pt}
\[
	a_{\textsf{rem}} \eqdef [\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}]: \cell{\li x}{10} * \cell{\li y}{10} * \cell{\li z}{10} \swap [\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]
\]
%
That is, when \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} all hold value $10$, any thread in possession of all three $[\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]$ capabilities in its local state can carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$. In doing so, the acting thread will remove the three cells from the shared state (and move them into its local state). In return, it must transfer the three locally held capabilities into the shared state. Note that after adding $a_{\textsf{rem}}$, the subjective views of all three threads remain stable since each thread locally holds one of the capabilities in $\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}$ and thus knows that the environment cannot carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$ (as it is missing at least one of the required capabilities). Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state); dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$ denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local state).

In \S\ref{sec:examples}
%Appendix~\ref{sec:mutual-exclusion} 
we generalise the mutual
exclusion ring presented in this section to $n$ threads and
demonstrate how it can be used to guard a shared resource accessed concurrently. In particular, since at each point in time only one thread may perform an action, that thread can be
granted the guarded resource exclusively (similarly to holding a lock).


%
%We also note that, as in the CAP family~\cite{cap,icap,tada}, \colosl
%cannot ensure that proved programs do not leak memory. Indeed, one may
%at any point of a proof stash leaked resources into a new subjective
%view, then weaken the resulting assertion to remove that view from the
%current state, rendering the leak invisible as far as the proof system
%is concerned.

%% This finishes the justification of all uses of \eqref{eq:shift} in the
%% derivations of \S\ref{subsec:threads}, and thus the derivations
%% themselves.  In this section, we have informally justified
%% manipulations of the interference relation by semantic
%% arguments. However, \S\ref{sec:shiftax} will show how the reasoning
%% involved can be reduced to simple logical implications between
%% separation logic formulas that do not mention the shared state.



%% In the case of the less local predicate $G$, whenever the
%% pre-condition of the action associated with $\token a_{\small\li z}$ is satisfied
%% (third disjunct), it is also the case that $\cell{\li{x}}{v+1}$. In other
%% words, in all the cases where the shared state satisfies
%% $\cell{\li{y}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v}$, it also satisfies $\cell{\li{x}}{v+1} *
%% \cell{\li{y}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v}$. However, this information is not
%% reflected in $I$ and as a result when weakening $G$, we need to
%% stabilise the resultant assertion which proves to be very weak. To
%% remedy this, in \colosl we introduce the notion of action
%% \emph{shifting} (rewriting) with respect to the \emph{invariant} of
%% the shared state. Given $\shared{P}{I'}$, we write $\fence{} \fences
%% (P, I')$ - read ``$\fence{}$ fences $P$ with respect to $I'$'' - to
%% indicate that i) $\fence{}$ contains all states associated with $P$
%% and ii) it is closed under $I'$; that is, given any action in $I'$
%% whose pre-condition is satisfied by a state in $\fence{}$, the state
%% resulting from the action is also in $\fence{}$. For instance, given
%% the $G$ predicate of \fig\ref{fig:concurrentIncCoLoSLSpec}, we have
%% $\fence{G} \fences (P_G, I)$ where $P_G$ denotes the assertion inside
%% the box and $\fence{G}$ is as specified below.
%% \[
%% 	\begin{array}{l l}
%% 		\fence{G} = \hspace*{-5pt}& \left\{\cell{\li{x}}{v} * \cell{\li{y}}{v} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} ||| v \in \{0, \cdots 10\} \right\} \\
%% 		& \cup \left\{\cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{y}}{v} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} ||| v \in \{0, \cdots 9 \} \right\} \\
%% 		& \cup \left\{\cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{y}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} ||| v \in \{0, \cdots 9\} \right\}\\
%% 	\end{array}
%% \]
%% %as well as the action associated with its update
%% Given the above invariant, we can now \emph{shift} the action associated with $\token a_{\small\li z}$ in $I$ and arrive at $I'$ where
%% \[
%% 	I' \eqdef \left\{
%% 		\begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
%% 			\token a_{\small\li x}:\, \exsts{v} \cell{\li{x}}{v} * \cell{\li{z}}{v}  \swap  \cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v}\\
%% 			\token a_{\small\li y}:\, \exsts{v} \cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{y}}{v}  \swap  \cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{y}}{v+1}\\
%% 			\token a_{\small\li z}:\, \exsts{v} \cell{\li{x}}{v+1} *
%%                         \cell{\li{y}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} \swap\null\\
%% 			\hspace*{2cm} \cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{y}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v+1}\\
%% 		\end{array}			
%% 	\right.
%% \]
%% Note that in doing so we have neither restricted nor relaxed the action of $\token a_{\small\li z}$ in that it can be carried out in exactly the same states given the invariant $\fence{G}$. This is formalised by the \shiftRule\ rule where $I \weakenI{\fence{}} I'$ denotes the shifting of $I$ with respect to $\fence{}$ and we defer its formalisation to \S\ref{sec:logic}.
%% \[
%% 	\text{if}\hspace*{0.25cm} \fence{} \fences (P, I) 
%% 	\hspace*{0.25cm}\text{and}\hspace*{0.25cm} I \weakenI{\fence{}} I'
%% 	\hspace*{0.25cm}\text{then}\hspace*{0.25cm}
%% 	\shared{P}{I} ===> \shared{P}{I'} \hspace*{0.5cm} \shiftRule
%% \]
%% Given predicate $G$ of \fig\ref{fig:concurrentIncCoLoSLSpec}, we can first shift $I$ into $I'$ (specified above) using the \textsc{Shift} rule and then apply the \forgetRule\ rule to forget variable \li{y} and obtain $\shared{a_{\small\li x}}{I'}$.
%% %%
%% %\[
%% %	X' \eqdef \shared{\exsts{v} \cell{\li{x}}{v} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} \lor \cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v}}{I'} 
%% %\]
%% %%
%% We have almost arrived at a local specification for $\mathbb{P}_{\small\li x}$. However, the action of $\token a_{\small\li y}$ is still visible in $I'$ even though it does not affect the values of \li{x} or \li{z}. Through interference shifting, we can not only rewrite actions with respect to the invariant, we can also \emph{forget} actions that affect \emph{none} of the states contained in the invariant. For instance, let $\fence{\li{x}} = \left\{\cell{\li{x}}{v} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} ||| v \in \{0, \cdots 10\} \right\} \cup \left\{\cell{\li{x}}{v+1} * \cell{\li{z}}{v} ||| v \in \{0, \cdots 9 \} \right\}$, then we have $\fence{X} \fences (X, I')$. In the case of the action of $\token a_{\small\li y}$, given any state $p$ in the action pre-condition (e.g. $p = \cell{\li{x}}{1} * \cell{\li{y}}{0}$), for an arbitrary state $s \in \fence{X}$ (e.g. $s = \cell{\li{x}}{1} * \cell{\li{z}}{0}$), \emph{all overlaps} of $p$ and $s$ ($p \meetL s = \{\cell{\li{x}}{1}\}$) are preserved by the action. We give the formal definition of overlap operator $\meetL$ in \S\ref{sec:logic}. 

%% Given $I'$ and $\fence{X}$ we can again apply the \textsc{Shift} rule in order to forget about the action of $\token a_{\small\li y}$ and obtain $I_{\small\li x}'$ as specified in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentIncSubjectiveSpec}. We can take analogous steps in order to obtain subjective views $S_{\small\li y}$ and $S_{\small\li z}$ for threads $\tau_{\small\li y}$ and $\tau_{\small\li z}$. We then pass the $\token a_{\small\li x}$, $\token a_{\small\li y}$ and $\token a_{\small\li z}$ capabilities to $\tau_{\small\li x}$, $\tau_{\small\li y}$ and $\tau_{\small\li z}$ and verify $\mathbb{INC}$ as follows:
