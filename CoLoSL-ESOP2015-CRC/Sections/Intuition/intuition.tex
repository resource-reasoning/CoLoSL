\section{Informal Development}
\label{sec:intuition}

We illustrate our \colosl reasoning principles by sketching a proof of
a variation of Dijkstra's token-ring mutual exclusion algorithm, which
pioneered \emph{self-stabilising} distributed
algorithms~\cite{dijkstra74}: starting from any arbitrary
(distributed) state, the algorithm converges to a \emph{legitimate}
state, which remains legitimate forevermore.

The token ring algorithm, presented in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc},
assumes a network of $n$ machines (in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc},
$n=3$), arranged in a ring with a designated \emph{master} machine and
$n{-}1$ slave machines. Each machine maintains a local counter and has
access to the value of its left neighbour's counter; the state of the
system consists of all $n$ counters. Starting in an arbitrary state,
the network eventually converges to legitimate
states~\cite{dijkstra-proof}, of the following form: 
in the $i$th legitimate state, all machines in the range $0\cdots i$ (with machine $0$ being the master) have some value $v{+}1$, and all others in the $i \cdots n{-}1$ range have value $v$.  In the $i$th legitimate state, only the $i$th machine can make progress: it increments its counter by $1$ and takes the system to the next legitimate state ($i{+}1 \,\text{mod}\, n$). Thus, this token ring provides mutual exclusion that can be used to control access to a shared resource. The $i$th legitimate state is depicted below (for both $i>0$ and $i=0$).  \\ \null\hfill
%a number of 
%successive machines in the ring have the same value $v+1$ (up to say,
%machine $i$, with machine $0$ being the master), then the others have
%value $v$.  In a legitimate state, only one machine at a time is able
%to make progress: either the $i+1$st machine if $i\neq 0$, or the
%master machine if $i=0$ (i.e.\ all machines in the ring hold the same
%value). Both situations are depicted below. Thus, this token ring
%provides mutual exclusion that can be used to mitigate access to a
%shared resource.\\ \null\hfill

In~\cite{colosl-tr14}, we outline a proof sketch of token ring's
self-stabilisation phase in \colosl and are able to show that,
starting from an arbitrary state, the system converges to a legitimate
state. We also provide a proof of the token ring when used for mutual
exclusion.  In the remainder of this section, we illustrate the
\colosl reasoning principles through a token ring in a legitimate
state where all counters hold value $0$.  These principles are laid
out in \fig\ref{fig:principles}, together with the usual concurrency
rule of separation logic~\cite{csl-tcs}, and the rule of consequence
from the Views framework~\cite{views}.  We introduce them informally
as needed, and present them in more details in \S\ref{sec:colosl}.

\colosl introduces a new assertion $\shared{P} I$ called a
\emph{subjective view}, which comprises an assertion $P$ describing
\emph{parts} of the global shared state and an interference assertion
$I$ which characterises how this partial shared state may be changed
by the thread or the environment. Similar to interference assertions
of CAP, $I$ declares transitions of the form $[\token a] : Q \swap R$,
where a thread in possession of the $[\token a]$ capability (in its
private state) may carry out its transition and update parts of the
shared state that satisfy $Q$ to those described by $R$. Assertions in
Hoare triples must be {\em stable}, that is, robust with respect to
interferences from the environment (as prescribed in the interference
relations attached to that assertion's subjective views). The $*$
(resp.\ $**$) connective is that of separation logic and means that
the current state is a disjoint (resp.\ potentially overlapping)
composition of two states satisfying each sub-formula. The overlapping
conjunction $**$ has been used in the past to reason about sharing in
data structures~\cite{rey-slnotes,js-popl12,ramification}. The
\emph{view shift}~\cite{views} (or
\emph{repartitioning}~\cite{cap-ecoop10}) $P ===> Q$ means that an
(instrumented) state satisfying $P$ may be manipulated without
changing the machine states it denotes. In particular, $(P => Q) => (P
===> Q)$.

Consider the program $\li{ring(x)}$ defined in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} representing a 3-place token ring.
%ignoring the assertions (lines starting with \li{//}). 
%We represent each machine in the ring as a heap address that records the value of the counter 
It is written in pseudo-code resembling C with additional constructs
for concurrency: atomic sections $\atomic \_$ which declare that code
behaves atomically; and parallel composition $\_ ||\_ $ which spawns
threads then waits until they complete. In our example, three threads
are spawned (corresponding to the master thread and two slave threads)
and are run in parallel until all counters reach value $10$.
%(in the fashion described above).

Note that this implementation can easily be generalised to an
$n$-place ring. We focus on a 3-place ring instead for
concision. While the implementation of all slave threads are
identical, the proof of the first slave in the ring (at $x{+}1$) is
slightly different from that of the others. For clarity, we henceforth
refer to the first slave thread as the \emph{foreman}.  Let us proceed
with the proof outline of slave threads. The proof of the master and
foreman threads are similar.% and can be described analogously.

%% In our reasoning, we represent the resources associated with each

  with $F_x'$, which is needed to prove the first slave of the ring
  (the foreman).}
\label{fig:concurrentInc}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Slave machines}
Let us forget for a moment about the proof outline of
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} and attempt to prove \li{slave} in
isolation, in the spirit of compositional reasoning. Since
\li{slave(x)} inspects the value of its counter pointed to by \li{x}
and compares it against the counter at \li{x-1} (its left neighbour in
the ring), a tempting pre-condition for the $\li{slave(x)}$ program
would capture just these two locations, e.g.
\vspace{-3pt}
\[
\li{x} \harpoonything x * [\token{s}_x] * \shared{\cell{x}{0} * (\cell{x{-}1}{0} \lor \cell{x{-}1}{1})}{S_x}
\qquad
S_x = \{s_{x}, s_{x{-}1}\}
\vspace{-3pt}
\]
Going left to right, the above assertion states that the thread
locally owns  variable \li{x} with value $x$ (with variables-as-resource model~\cite{variablesAsResource}), and a
\emph{capability} $[\token{s}_x]$ that allows it to perform the
associated $s_x$ action (see below and \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}).  The
current thread also has a subjective view of the shared state: $x$
points to $0$ and $x-1$ points to either $0$ or $1$, since its left
neighbour might have already incremented its own counter. The
interference relation is captured by $S_x$ and consists of two
actions: $s_x$ and $s_{x{-}1}$, where $s_{x}$ represent an increment
of the contents of $x$ under the condition that its value is one less
than the value at address $x-1$. Since it owns $[\token s_x]$, the
current thread is the only one that can perform $s_x$. On the other
hand, the capability $[\token s_{x{-}1}]$ is not locally owned, thus
could be owned by the environment, which is free to perform the
associated action whenever its precondition is satisfied.
%that performed by the current machine (enabled by $[\token{x}]$); and that of the previous machine in the ring (enabled by $[\token{s}_p]$). Each action allows the value of the corresponding machine to be incremented by $1$ so long is it is the one that can make a move (As described above). 
Upon closer inspection, since the subjective view says nothing of the
value of cell $x{-}2$, $s_{x{-}1}$ can always fire in this
situation. This assertion is thus not \emph{stable}. If we were to
weaken it into a stable assertion, we would get the assertion below,
which is now too imprecise for our purposes:\vspace{-3pt}
\[
\li{x} \harpoonything x * [\token{s}_x] * \shared{\exsts{v}
  \cell{x}{0} * \cell{x{-}1}{v}}{S_x}
\vspace{-3pt}
\]

To remedy this, we have to step back and think again at the level of
the whole algorithm. As the programmer knows, the situation above
cannot happen as $x{-}2$ can only be at most one ahead of $x$ itself.
It is thus possible to strengthen $S_x$ to $S'_x$ and give a stronger precondition that captures just
what we want, as in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. The proof of
$\li{slave(x)}$ is now relatively straightforward. By inspection (or
using the rules of \S\ref{subsec:prules}), the invariant of the while
loop is stable with respect to $S'_x$. The atomic section performs
action $s_x$ (temporarily ``opening the box'', i.e.\ transferring
shared resources into the local state to perform the update) and
preserves the invariant.  The final postcondition of $\li{slave(x)}$
follows from the invariant and the boolean expression of the loop.

\paragraph{The ring}
The proof sketches of the foreman (first slave) and master threads are
analogous, following \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. As the first slave,
the foreman has to account for interference from the master thread
instead of another slave thread. Note that the master has access to
variable \li{n} that indicates the current size of the ring, and so
does its associated action $m_x$ since whether it can fire or not is
decided by the value of the counter at address $x+n$. Let us now
detail the proof of \li{ring(x)}.

The precondition of \li{ring} states that it owns all capabilities,
which will be distributed amongst the three threads; the global
variable \li{n} holding the size of the ring is shared, as well as all
three counters initialised to 0. The interference $I$ associated with
the subjective view consists of all actions. Because at this stage we
have a global view of the state of the ring (and moreover all
capabilities are held locally), the ``small'' actions $s_{x+i}$ are
enough to guarantee stability. Let us write $\shared P I$ for this
initial subjective view.

This subjective view may be freely duplicated using the \copyRule
principle and each thread is given a copy together with the
appropriate capability using the \parRule rule. For instance, the
thread running \li{slave(x+2)} gets $[\token{s}_{x{+}2}] *
\shared{P}{I}$.  This assertion does not match the pre-condition of
\li{slave(x+2)} just yet. Using the principles given
in \fig\ref{fig:principles}, we can weaken the assertion as such:
\begin{align*}
  \shared{P}{I}
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{P}{\{m_x, s'_{x{+}1}, s_{x{+}2}\}} \\[-5pt]
  &\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\cell{x{+}1}{0} * \cell{x{+}2}{0}}{\{m_x, s'_{x{+}1}, s_{x{+}2}\}} \\[-5pt]
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\cell{x{+}1}{0} * \cell{x{+}2}{0}}{S'_{x{+}2}} \\[-5pt]
  &\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\cell{x{+}2}{0} * (\cell{x{+}1}{0} \lor \cell{x{+}1}{1})}{S'_{x{+}2}}
\end{align*}

We begin by rewriting the $s_{x{+}1}$ action of $I$ into the stronger
action of $s'_{x{+}1}$ using \shiftRule. In general, \shiftRule allows
us to replace $I$ with any interference relation $I'$ that has the
same observable effect as far as the subjective assertion $P$ of the
subjective view is concerned (written $I \weakenI{P} I'$). In this
instance, actions $s_{x{+}2}$ and $s'_{x{+}2}$ have the same effects
according to $P$: as the programmer knows, whenever the value of
$x{+}1$ is greater than $x{+}2$ by 1, then $x$ is also greater than
$x{+}2$ by 1 (and is equal to $x$). As such, rewriting $s_{x{+}1}$ as
$s'_{x{+}2}$ does not alter its behaviour and merely reflects stronger
knowledge about how $x{+}2$ and $x$ are related through $x{+}1$. In
particular, $I\weakenI{P} \{m_{x}, s'_{x{+}2}, s_{x{+}2}\}$ as
required.

Next, because subjective views only describe \emph{parts} of the
shared state, we can use the \forgetRule principle to obtain a weaker
view of the shared state, in this case a view that ignores the cell at
address $x$.  With $x$ out of scope, the action $m_{x}$ no longer has
observable effects on the new assertion as it leaves other cells
unchanged. We can thus apply the \shiftRule principle again to rid the
interference of $m_{x}$ and get $S'_{x{+}2}$.

Finally, we weaken the resulting subjective view so that it is stable
with respect to $S'_{x{+}2}$, i.e.\ preserved by those of its actions
that environment is allowed to perform (here, $s'_{x{+}2}$). This
yields the precondition of \li{slave(x+2)} as in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. The pre-conditions of the master and
foreman threads can be derived analogously.

Once all threads have completed their operations, we join up their
postconditions using the \mergeRule principle, which embodies a
crucial feature of \colosl: different subjective views
\emph{overlap}. Since $|/$ distributes over $**$, the subjective view
simplifies to $\shared{\cell{x}{10} * \cell{x{+}1}{10} *
  \cell{x{+}2}{10}}{S'_{x} \cup S'_{x{+}1} \cup
  S'_{x{+}2}}$. Finally, since $S'_{x} \cup S'_{x{+}1} \cup
S'_{x{+}2}$ $\weakenI{\li{n}|-< n * \cell{x}{10} * \cell{x{+}1}{10} *
  \cell{x{+}2}{10}} I $, by the \shiftRule principle, we get
the postcondition of \li{ring(x)}.


%\paragraph{Comparison with other formalisms}
This concludes our \colosl proof of \li{ring(x)}. Our expansion and
contraction of subjective views, in particular with shifting of
interference assertions in key places, enables us to confine the
specification and verification of each thread to just the resources
they need. This is not possible in existing frameworks. Small
specifications make proofs robust against changes to each thread's
environment, and provide more opportunities for proof reuse. For
instance, our proof of the ring straightforwardly generalises to $n$
slave threads, without needing to reprove \li{master} or \li{slave} at
all. Moreover, the proof changes only minimally if the main program is
changed to dynamically grow the ring by spawning more slave threads
(we leave the details to the accompanying technical report): the proof
of \li{master} has to be modified slightly to include the possibility
for the last node of the ring to change. The proof of \li{slave} is
unchanged.

In contrast, the shared state in previous work has to include the
global interference relation. In both of the extensions described
above, this relation would need to change and the proofs of all
threads would need to be adapted.

We complete our semi-formal overview by noting that unlike
CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and as in iCAP~\cite{icap}, we do not provide
an explicit \emph{unsharing} mechanism to claim shared resources and
render them thread-local. Instead, this behaviour can be simply
encoded for a resource described by $P$ and associated with tokens
$\token{a}_1$, \ldots $\token{a}_{n}$ as, e.g., an additional action
of the form
\[
[\token{a}_1] * \cdots * [\token{a}_{n}]{:}\, P \swap [\token{a}_1] * \cdots * [\token{a}_{n}]
\]
That is, a thread holding all the tokens can remove the resource $P$
from the shared state and move them into its local state. In return,
it must transfer the associated capabilities into the shared
state. Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource
transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only
appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from
the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state);
dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$
denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local
state).


%% . For instance, in order to
%% remove the \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} variables from the shared state
%% at the end of the $\mathbb{INC}$ program, one can add the following
%% action to all of the above interference assertions ($I$,
%% $I_{\small\li{x}}'$,
%% $I_{\small\li{y}}'$, and $I_{\small\li{z}}'$):
%% %
%% \vspace{-5pt}
%% \[
%% 	a_{\textsf{rem}} \eqdef [\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}]: \cell{\li x}{10} * \cell{\li y}{10} * \cell{\li z}{10} \swap [\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]
%% \]
%% %
%% That is, when \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} all hold value $10$, any thread in possession of all three $[\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]$ capabilities in its local state can carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$. In doing so, the acting thread will remove the three cells from the shared state (and move them into its local state). In return, it must transfer the three locally held capabilities into the shared state. Note that after adding $a_{\textsf{rem}}$, the subjective views of all three threads remain stable since each thread locally holds one of the capabilities in $\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}$ and thus knows that the environment cannot carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$ (as it is missing at least one of the required capabilities). Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state); dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$ denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local state).

\julescomment{Move the below to next section.}

We also note that, as in the CAP family~\cite{cap-ecoop10,icap,tada}, \colosl
cannot ensure that proved programs do not leak memory. Indeed, one may
at any point of a proof stash leaked resources into a new subjective
view, then weaken the resulting assertion to remove that view from the
current state, rendering the leak invisible as far as the proof system
is concerned.
