\section{Informal Development}
\label{sec:intuition}

We sketch a proof of an implementation of Dijkstra's token ring mutual
exclusion algorithm, which pioneered \emph{self-stabilising}
distributed algorithms~\cite{dijkstra74}. Our proof highlights the main
reasoning principles of \colosl and results in \emph{small
  specifications} for each participant in the ring. Besides their
concision, we show how small specifications are robust against
non-trivial changes to the algorithm.

The algorithm %presented in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}, assumes a
network of $n{+}1$ machines arranged in a ring, with a designated
\emph{master} machine and $n$ slave machines. Each machine maintains a
local counter and has access to the value of its left neighbour's
counter; the state of the system consists of all $n{+}1$
counters. Starting in an arbitrary state, the network eventually
stabilises to legitimate states~\cite{dijkstra-proof}, with the
following global property: in the $i$th legitimate state, machines
$0$ to $i{-}1$ (machine $0$ being the master) have some
value $v{+}1$, and all others have value
$v$.  In the $i$th legitimate state, only the $i$th machine (indicated
by $\bullet$ below) can make
progress: it increments its counter by $1$ and takes the system to the
next legitimate state ($i{+}1 \,\text{mod}\, n{+}1$). For a ring at
address $x$, the $i$th legitimate state is depicted below (for both
$i>0$ and $i=0$).  \\ \null\hfill
%a number of 
%successive machines in the ring have the same value $v+1$ (up to say,
%machine $i$, with machine $0$ being the master), then the others have
%value $v$.  In a legitimate state, only one machine at a time is able
%to make progress: either the $i+1$st machine if $i\neq 0$, or the
%master machine if $i=0$ (i.e.\ all machines in the ring hold the same
%value). Both situations are depicted below. Thus, this token ring
%provides mutual exclusion that can be used to mitigate access to a
%shared resource.\\ \null\hfill

In~\cite{colosl-tr14}, we outline a proof of the token ring's
self-stabilisation phase, which shows that the system always converges
to a legitimate state. We also provide a proof of the token ring as a
mutual exclusion mechanism, where a machine holding $\bullet$ may gain
ownership of a shared resource. For simplicity, we focus here on the
case where the token ring is already in the $0$th legitimate state,
with all counters holding value $0$. Our proof makes use of the
\colosl principles laid out in \fig\ref{fig:principles}, together with
the usual concurrency rule of separation logic~\cite{csl-tcs} and the
rule of semantic consequence from the Views framework~\cite{views}.
We introduce them informally as needed, and present them in more
details in \S\ref{sec:colosl}.

\colosl introduces a new assertion $\shared{P} I$ called a
\emph{subjective view}, which comprises a \emph{subjective assertion} $P$ describing
a \emph{part} of the global shared state, and an \emph{interference assertion}
$I$ which characterises how this partial shared state may be changed
by the thread or the environment. Similar to interference assertions
of CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and permissions of deny-guarantee~\cite{dg},
$I$ declares actions of the form $[\token a] : Q \swap R$, where a
thread in possession of the $[\token a]$ capability (in its local state) may carry out its transition and update parts of the shared
state satisfying $Q$ to a state satisfying $R$. Assertions in Hoare
triples must be {\em stable} with respect to the interference from the environment: that is, robust with respect to the interference assertion $I$.

Consider the program $\li{ring(x)}$ defined in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} representing a token ring with $n{+}1$
machines.
%ignoring the assertions (lines starting with \li{//}). 
%We represent each machine in the ring as a heap address that records the value of the counter 
It is written in pseudo-code resembling C with additional constructs
for concurrency: atomic sections $\atomic \_$ which declare that code
behaves atomically; and parallel composition $\_ ||\_ $ which spawns
threads then waits until they complete. In our example, the $n{+}1$ threads
run in parallel until all counters reach value $10$.
%(in the fashion described above).
%Note that this implementation can easily be generalised to an
%$n$-place ring. We focus on a 3-place ring for concision.
While the implementation of all the slave threads are identical, we shall see that the proof of the
first slave in the ring (at $x{+}1$) is slightly different from the
others, for which a single proof suffices.
We henceforth refer to the first slave thread as the
\emph{foreman}.  Let us proceed with the proof of the other
slaves.

%% the address of the previous machine in the ring (at address $x+1$).
%% We now proceed with the proof outline of slave threads. The proof of
%% the master and foreman threads are similar and can be described
%% analogously.

\paragraph{Proof of the slave}
Let us temporarily forget about the proof outline of
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} and attempt to prove \li{slave(x)} in
isolation, in the spirit of local reasoning. Since
\li{slave(x)} inspects the value of its counter pointed to by \li{x}
and compares it against the counter at \li{x-1} (its left neighbour in
the ring), a tempting precondition for $\li{slave(x)}$ would be one describing
just these two locations, e.g.
\[
\li{x} \harpoonything x * [\token{s}_x] * \shared{\cell{x}{0} * (\cell{x{-}1}{0} \lor \cell{x{-}1}{1})}{S_x}
\qquad
S_x = \{s_{x}, s_{x{-}1}\}
\]
%
The above assertion comprises: a) a variable assertion stating that the thread
locally owns  variable \li{x} with value $x$ (using the variables-as-resource model~\cite{variablesAsResource}); b) a
\emph{capability} $[\token{s}_x]$ that allows it to perform the
associated $s_x$ action (see below); and c) a subjective view of the shared state: $x$
points to $0$, and $x{-}1$, its left neighbour, points to either $0$ or
$1$ since it might already have incremented its own counter.
 The $*$
connective used between assertions is that of separation logic and
means that the assertions describe \emph{disjoint} pieces of state.
 The
interference assertion associated with the subjective view is captured by $S_x$ and consists of two
actions: $s_x$ and $s_{x{-}1}$, where $s_{x}$ represent an increment
of the contents of $x$ under the condition that its value is one less
than the value at address $x{-}1$ (see
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}). Since the current thread owns $[\token s_x]$ locally,
only it can perform $s_x$. On the
other hand, the capability $[\token s_{x{-}1}]$ is not locally owned,
thus the environment could potentially perform the associated action
whenever its precondition (on the left-hand side of $\swap$) is
satisfied.
%that performed by the current machine (enabled by $[\token{x}]$); and that of the previous machine in the ring (enabled by $[\token{s}_p]$). Each action allows the value of the corresponding machine to be incremented by $1$ so long is it is the one that can make a move (As described above). 
Upon closer inspection, since this subjective view says nothing of the
value of the cell at address $x{-}2$, $s_{x{-}1}$ could potentially
\emph{always} fire. The assertion is thus not \emph{stable}: nothing
prevents the counter at $x{-}1$ from incrementing beyond value 1. A
weaker, stable assertion is thus:
\[
\li{x} \harpoonything x * [\token{s}_x] * \shared{\exsts{v}
  \cell{x}{0} * \cell{x{-}1}{v}}{S_x}
\]

Fortunately, we can do better and obtain a stronger small
precondition.  Let us first step back and think again at the level of
the whole algorithm. As the programmer knows, the situation above
cannot happen as $x{-}2$ can only be at most one ahead of $x$ itself.
We can thus replace $S_x$ by $S'_x$ and give a stronger stable
precondition that captures just what we want, as in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. The proof of $\li{slave(x)}$ is now
relatively straightforward. By inspection (or using the rules of
\S\ref{subsec:prules}), the invariant of the while loop and the
postcondition are also stable. The atomic section temporarily ``opens
the box'' to perform action $s_x$ then ``closes back the box'', and
preserves the invariant.  The final postcondition of $\li{slave(x)}$
follows from the invariant and the boolean expression of the loop.

\paragraph{Proof of the master and foreman}
The proof sketches of the master and foreman threads sketched in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} are analogous. As the first slave, the
foreman has to account for interference from the master instead of
another slave. Moreover, the master and its associated action $m_x$
have access to variable \li{n} holding the current size of the ring,
since they depend on the value of the counter at address $x+n$.
%Let us now detail the proof of \li{ring(x)}.

\paragraph{Proof of the ring}
The precondition of \li{ring(x)} states that it owns all capabilities,
which will be distributed amongst the $n{+}1$ threads; the global
variable $\li{n} \harpoonything n$ is shared, as are all $n{+}1$ counters, initialised
to 0. The interference $I$ associated with the subjective view
consists of the actions of the $n{+}1$ threads. Because \li{ring(x)} has a global view
of the state of the ring (and moreover all capabilities are held
locally), the $s_{x+i}$ actions are enough to guarantee
stability.

Let us write $\shared P I$ for this initial subjective
view. This assertion may be freely duplicated using the \copyRule
principle of \fig\ref{fig:principles} and each thread is given a copy together with the
appropriate capability using the usual \parRule rule of concurrent
separation logic. For instance, the
thread running \li{slave(x+$i$)} ($i>1$) gets $[\token{s}_{x{+}i}] *
\shared{P}{I}$.  This assertion does not match the precondition of
\li{slave(x+$i$)} just yet. Using the principles of \fig\ref{fig:principles}, we can weaken the assertion as such:
%
\begin{align*}
  \shared{P}{I} 
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{P}{\left(I \setminus \{s_{x{+}i{-}1}\}\right)\cup \{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}\}}
%  {\{m_x\} \cup \{s_{x{+}j} \mid 1 \leq j < i-1\} \cup \{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}\} \cup \{s_{x{+} j} \mid  i \leq j \leq n\}}
  \\[-5pt]
%  
  &\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\cell{x{+}i{-}1}{0} * \cell{x{+}i}{0}}{\left(I \setminus \{s_{x{+}i{-}1}\}\right)\cup \{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}\}} \\[-5pt]
%  
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\cell{x{+}i{-}1}{0} * \cell{x{+}i}{0}}{\{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}, s_{x{+}i}\}}\\[-5pt]
% 
  &\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>}
  \shared{\cell{x{+}i}{0} * (\cell{x{+}i{-}1}{0} \lor \cell{x{+}i{-}1}{1})}{\{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}, s_{x{+}i}\}}
\end{align*}
%
We start by exchanging the action $s_{x{+}i{-}1}$ of $I$ for the stronger
action $s'_{x{+}i{-}1}$ using \shiftRule. In general, \shiftRule allows
us to replace $I$ with any interference assertion $I'$ that has the
same observable effect as far as the subjective assertion $P$ of the
subjective view is concerned (written $I \weakenI{P} I'$). In this
instance, the actions $s_{x{+}i{-}1}$ and $s'_{x{+}i{-}1}$ have the same effect
according to $P$, as discussed in the proof of \li{slave(x)}. As such,
rewriting $s_{x{+}i{-}1}$ as $s'_{x{+}i{-}1}$
merely reflects stronger knowledge about how $x{+}i$ and $x{+}i{-}2$ are
related through $x{+}i{-}1$. In particular, $I\weakenI{P} \left(I \setminus \{s_{x{+}i{-}1}\}\right)\cup \{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}\}$ as required.

Next, because subjective views only describe \emph{parts} of the
shared state, we can use the \forgetRule principle to obtain a weaker
view of the shared state, in this case a view that ignores all cells
in the ring except for those at addresses $x{+}i{-}1$ and $x{+}i$. With all other cells out of the scope, their actions no longer have
observable effects on the assertion, since they leave $x{+}i{-}1$ and $x{+}i$ unchanged. We can thus apply the \shiftRule principle again to \emph{frame off}
those actions and obtain $S'_{x{+}i} = \{s'_{x{+}i{-}1}, s_{x{+}i}\}$.

Finally, we weaken the resulting subjective view so that it is stable
with respect to $S'_{x{+}i}$, i.e.\ preserved by those of its actions
that the environment may perform (here, $s'_{x{+}i{-}1}$). This
yields the precondition of \li{slave(x+$i$)} as in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. The preconditions of the master and
foreman threads can be derived analogously.

Once all threads have completed their operations, we join up their
postconditions using the \mergeRule principle, which embodies a
crucial feature of \colosl: different subjective views
\emph{overlap}. The overlapping conjunction $**$ between two
assertions means that the two assertions describe potentially
\emph{overlapping} pieces of state. In particular, $A * B => A ** B$
and $A /| B => A**B$. This connective has been used in the past to
reason about sharing in data
structures~\cite{rey-slnotes,js-popl12,ramification}.  Since $|/$
distributes over $**$, the subjective view simplifies to
$\shared{\cell{x}{10} * \cell{x{+}1}{10} * \cdots *
  \cell{x{+}n}{10}}{I'}$ where $I' = M'_{x}\cup F'_{x{+}1} \cup
S'_{x{+}2}\cup \cdots \cup S'_{x{+}n}$.  Finally, since
$I'\weakenI{{\scriptli{n}}|-< n * \cell{x}{10} * \cell{x{+}1}{10} *
  \cdots * \cell{x{+}n}{10}} I $, we get the postcondition of
\li{ring(x)} by the \shiftRule principle. This concludes our \colosl
proof of \li{ring(x)}.

%We complete our semi-formal overview by noting that unlike
%CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and as in iCAP~\cite{icap}, we do not provide
%an explicit \emph{unsharing} mechanism to claim shared resources and
%render them thread-local. Instead, this behaviour can be simply
%encoded for a resource described by $P$ and associated with tokens
%$[\token{a}_1]$, \ldots , $[\token{a}_{n}]$ as an additional action
%of the form \vspace{0pt}
%\[
%[\token{a}_1] * \cdots * [\token{a}_{n}]{:}\, P \swap [\token{a}_1] * \cdots * [\token{a}_{n}]\vspace{0pt}
%\]
%That is, a thread holding all the tokens can remove the resource $P$
%from the shared state and move them into its local state. In return,
%it must transfer the associated capabilities into the shared
%state. Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource
%transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only
%appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from
%the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state);
%dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$
%denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local
%state).

\paragraph{Small specifications and proof reuse}
Our expansion and
contraction of subjective views, in particular with shifting of
interference assertions in key places, enables us to confine the
specification and verification of each thread to just the resources
they need. Such small specifications make proofs robust against changes to each thread's
environment, and provide more opportunities for proof reuse.
% For
%instance, our proof of the ring straightforwardly generalises to $n$
%slave threads, without needing to reprove \li{master} or \li{slave} at
%all. 

For instance, let us now add a thread that dynamically grows the ring
by spawning extra slaves to the parallel composition of \li{ring(x)}
(the details can be found in~\cite{colosl-tr14}). When the ring has
size $n$, we use the \extendRule principle as follows to add a new
slave (at $x{+}n{+}1$) to the shared state with the associated
interference relation and capability.\footnote{Unlike
  CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and as in iCAP~\cite{icap}, we do not provide
  an explicit \emph{unsharing} mechanism to claim back shared
  resources. Instead, this can be simply encoded as an action of the
  form $\bigvarstar_{j \in J}[\token{a}_j]{:}\, P \swap \bigvarstar_{j
    \in J}[\token{a}_j]$: a thread holding $\bigvarstar_{j \in
    J}[\token{a}_j]$ can move the shared resource $P$ into its local
  state in exchange for the associated capabilities.}
\begin{align*}
  \cell{(x{+}n{+}1)}{v} \stackrel{(\extendRule)}{\semimplies} \exsts{\token{s}_{x{+}n{+}1}}[\token{s}_{x{+}n{+}1}] * \shared{\cell{x{+}n{+}1}{v}}{\{s_{x{+}n{+}1}\}}
\end{align*}
Here, the
\emph{view shift}~\cite{views} (or
\emph{repartitioning}~\cite{cap-ecoop10}) $P ===> Q$ means that an
(instrumented) state satisfying $P$ may be changed to $Q$ without
changing the machine states it denotes. In particular, $(P => Q) => (P
===> Q)$.
Our proof changes only minimally to accommodate the new program: the proof
of \li{master(x)} has to account for the new
interference on $\li{n} \harpoonything n$ since the environment can grow the
ring and thus mutate $\li{n} \harpoonything n$, and the proofs of
other threads can be directly reused.

In contrast, in existing CAP-like approaches~\cite{cap-ecoop10,tada}, both $\li{n} \harpoonything n$ and the global interference relation are observed by all threads.  As such, with the above extension, the global interference relation needs to change (to include the interference on $\li{n} \harpoonything n$) and the proofs of \emph{both} master and slave threads need to be adapted.

%% . For instance, in order to
%% remove the \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} variables from the shared state
%% at the end of the $\mathbb{INC}$ program, one can add the following
%% action to all of the above interference assertions ($I$,
%% $I_{\small\li{x}}'$,
%% $I_{\small\li{y}}'$, and $I_{\small\li{z}}'$):
%% %
%% \vspace{-5pt}
%% \[
%% 	a_{\textsf{rem}} \eqdef [\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}]: \cell{\li x}{10} * \cell{\li y}{10} * \cell{\li z}{10} \swap [\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]
%% \]
%% %
%% That is, when \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} all hold value $10$, any thread in possession of all three $[\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]$ capabilities in its local state can carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$. In doing so, the acting thread will remove the three cells from the shared state (and move them into its local state). In return, it must transfer the three locally held capabilities into the shared state. Note that after adding $a_{\textsf{rem}}$, the subjective views of all three threads remain stable since each thread locally holds one of the capabilities in $\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}$ and thus knows that the environment cannot carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$ (as it is missing at least one of the required capabilities). Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state); dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$ denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local state).
