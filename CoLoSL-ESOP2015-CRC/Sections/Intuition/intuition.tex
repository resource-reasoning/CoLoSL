\section{Informal Development}
\label{sec:intuition}

We illustrate our \colosl reasoning principles by sketching a proof of
a variation of Dijkstra's token-ring mutual exclusion algorithm, which
pioneered \emph{self-stabilising} distributed
algorithms~\cite{dijkstra74}: starting from any arbitrary
(distributed) state, the algorithm converges to a \emph{legitimate}
state, which remains legitimate forevermore.

The token ring algorithm, presented in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc},
assumes a network of $n$ machines (in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc},
$n=3$), arranged in a ring with a designated \emph{master} machine and
$n-1$ slave machines. Each machine maintains a local counter and has
access to the value of its left neighbour's counter; the state of the
system consists of all $n$ counters. Starting in an arbitrary state,
the network eventually converges to legitimate
states~\cite{dijkstra-proof}, of the following form: a number of
successive machines in the ring have the same value $v+1$ (up to say,
machine $i$, with machine $0$ being the master), then the others have
value $v$.  In a legitimate state, only one machine at a time is able
to make progress: either the $i+1$st machine if $i\neq 0$, or the
master machine if $i=0$ (i.e.\ all machines in the ring hold the same
value). Both situations are depicted below. Thus, this token ring
provides mutual exclusion that can be used to mitigate access to a
shared resource.\\ \null\hfill

In~\cite{colosl-tr14}, we outline a proof sketch of token ring's
self-stabilisation phase in \colosl and are able to show that,
starting from an arbitrary state, the system converges to a legitimate
state. We also provide a proof of the token ring when used for mutual
exclusion.  In the remainder of this section, we illustrate the
\colosl reasoning principles through a token ring in a legitimate
state where all counters hold value $0$.  These principles are laid
out in \fig\ref{fig:principles}, together with the usual concurrency
rule of separation logic~\cite{csl-tcs}, and the rule of consequence
from the Views framework~\cite{views}.  We introduce them informally
as needed, and present them in more details in \S\ref{sec:colosl}.

\end{figure}

\colosl introduces a new assertion $\shared{P} I$ called a
\emph{subjective view}, which comprises an assertion $P$ describing
\emph{parts} of the global shared state and an interference assertion
$I$ which characterises how this partial shared state may be changed
by the thread or the environment. Similar to interference assertions
of CAP, $I$ declares transitions of the form $[\token a] : Q \swap R$,
where a thread in possession of the $[\token a]$ capability (in its
private state) may carry out its transition and update parts of the
shared state that satisfy $Q$ to those described by $R$. Assertions in
Hoare triples must be {\em stable}, that is, robust with respect to
interferences from the environment (as prescribed in the interference
relations attached to that assertion's subjective views). The $*$
(resp.\ $**$) connective is that of separation logic and means that
the current state is a disjoint (resp.\ potentially overlapping)
composition of two states satisfying each sub-formula. The overlapping
conjunction $**$ has been used in the past to reason about sharing in
data structures~\cite{rey-slnotes,js-popl12,ramification}. The
\emph{view shift}~\cite{views} (or
\emph{repartitioning}~\cite{cap-ecoop10}) $P ===> Q$ means that an
(instrumented) state satisfying $P$ may be manipulated without
changing the machine states it denotes. In particular, $(P => Q) => (P
===> Q)$.

Consider the program $\li{ring(x)}$ defined in
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} representing a 3-place token ring.
%ignoring the assertions (lines starting with \li{//}). 
%We represent each machine in the ring as a heap address that records the value of the counter 
It is written in pseudo-code resembling C with additional constructs
for concurrency: atomic sections $\atomic \_$ which declare that code
behaves atomically; and parallel composition $\_ ||\_ $ which spawns
threads then waits until they complete. In our example, three threads
are spawned (corresponding to the master thread and two slave threads)
and are run in parallel until all counters reach value $10$.
%(in the fashion described above).

Note that this implementation can easily be generalised to an
$n$-place ring. We focus on a 3-place ring instead for
concision. While the implementation of all slave threads are
identical, the proof of the first slave in the ring (at $x{+}1$) is
slightly different from that of the others. For clarity, we henceforth
refer to the first slave thread as the \emph{foreman}.  Let us proceed
with the proof outline of slave threads. The proof of the master and
foreman threads are similar.% and can be described analogously.

\label{fig:concurrentInc}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Slave machines}
Let us forget for a moment about the proof outline of
\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} and attempt to prove \li{slave} in
isolation, in the spirit of compositional reasoning. Since
\li{slave(x)} inspects the value of its counter pointed to by \li{x}
and compares it against the counter at \li{x-1} (its left neighbour in
the ring), a tempting pre-condition for the $\li{slave(x)}$ program
would capture just these two locations, e.g.
\vspace{-3pt}
\[
\li{x} \harpoonything x * [\token{s}_x] * \shared{\cell{x}{0} * (\cell{x{-}1}{0} \lor \cell{x{-}1}{1})}{S_x}
\qquad
S_x = \{s_{x}, s_{x{-}1}\}
\vspace{-3pt}
\]
Going left to right, the above assertion states that the thread
locally owns the variable \li{x} with value $x$, and a
\emph{capability} $\token{s}_x$ that allows it to perform the
associated action (see below and \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}).  The
current thread also has a subjective view of the shared state: $x$
points to $0$ and $x-1$ points to either $0$ or $1$, since its left
neighbour might have already incremented its own counter. The
interference relation is captured by $S_x$ and consists of two
actions: $s_x$ and $s_{x{-}1}$, where $s_{x}$ represent an increment
of the contents of $x$ under the condition that its value is one less
than the value at address $x-1$. Since it owns $\token s_x$, the
current thread is the only one that can perform $s_x$. On the other
hand, the capability $[\token s_{x{-}1}]$ is not locally owned, thus
could be owned by the environment, which is free to perform the
associated action whenever its precondition is satisfied.
%that performed by the current machine (enabled by $[\token{x}]$); and that of the previous machine in the ring (enabled by $[\token{s}_p]$). Each action allows the value of the corresponding machine to be incremented by $1$ so long is it is the one that can make a move (As described above). 
Upon closer inspection, since the subjective view says nothing of the
value of cell $x{-}2$, $s_{x{-}1}$ can always fire in this
situation. This assertion is thus not \emph{stable}. If we were to
weaken it into a stable assertion, we would get the assertion below,
which is now too imprecise for our purposes:\vspace{-3pt}
\[
\li{x} \harpoonything x * [\token{s}_x] * \shared{\exsts{v}
  \cell{x}{0} * \cell{x{-}1}{v}}{S_x}
\vspace{-3pt}
\]

To remedy this, we have to step back and think again at the level of
the whole algorithm. As the programmer knows, the situation above
cannot happen as $x{-}2$ can only be at most one ahead of $x$ itself.
It is thus possible to give a stronger precondition that captures just
what we want, as in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. The proof of
$\li{slave(x)}$ is now relatively straightforward. By inspection (or
using the rules of \S\ref{subsec:prules}), the invariant of the while
loop is stable with respect to $S'_x$. The atomic section performs
action $s_x$ (temporarily ``opening the box'', i.e.\ transferring
shared resources into the local state to perform the update) and
preserves the invariant.  The final postcondition of $\li{slave(x)}$
follows from the invariant and the boolean expression of the loop.

\paragraph{Foreman thread}
The proof sketch of the foreman (slave) thread is given in the left
column of~\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. This proof is similar to that
of other slave threads and the only difference lies in the
interference associated with the foreman thread. While the
interference of a slave thread contains the action of the slave itself
and that of the previous thread (which is also a slave), the
interference associated with the foreman thread contains the action of
the foreman itself and that of the master thread. The rest of the
proof outline can be justified analogously.

\paragraph{The ring algorithm}
The proof outline of the \li{ring(x0, x1, x2)} algorithm is given
in~\fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc}. The assertion on line~2 declares that
the current thread locally owns the three variables $\li{x0}$,
$\li{x1}$ and $\li{x2}$ recording the addresses of the master ($x_0$)
and slave machines ($x_1$ and $x_2$), respectively. Let $P =
\cell{x_0}{0, x_2} * \cell{x_1}{0, x_0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}$; the
subjective view $\shared{P}{I}$ describes the initial state of the
ring where all counters have value $0$ and each machine tracks the
address of the previous machine in the ring. The interference
associated with the subjective view ($I=\{m_{x_0}, s_{x_1},
s_{x_2}\}$) consists of actions that allow a thread to manipulate the
master ($m_{x_0}$) and slave counters ($s_{x_1}$ and $s_{x_2}$).
%, provided that it holds the pertinent capabilities ($[\token{m}_{x_0}]$, $[\token{s}_{x_1}]$, $[\token{s}_{x_2}]$, resp.) in its local state. 
Finally, the assertion in line~2 simply has all the capabilities
$[\token{m}_{x_0}] * [\token{s}_{x_1}] * [\token{s}_{x_2}]$ associated
with $I$ in the local state.

This subjective view may then be freely duplicated using the \copyRule
principle and each thread is given a copy together with the
appropriate capability using the \parRule rule. For instance, thread
running \li{slave(x2)} gets $ \varcell{\li{x2}}{x_2} *
[\token{s}_{x_2}] * \shared{P}{I} $.  However, this assertion does not
match the pre-condition of \li{slave(x2)}. We now demonstrate how we
can derive the desired pre-condition using the \colosl reasoning
principles given in~\fig\ref{fig:principles}. The pre-conditions of
the master and foreman threads can be obtained analogously.

%Because subjective views only describe \emph{parts} of the shared state, we can use the \forgetRule principle to obtain a weaker view of the shared state, in this case a view that ignores the two cells as $x_0$ as well as the previous sibling of $x_1$ as follows. However, as discussed above (see slave machines) the resulting subjective view is not necessarily stable any longer; and we need to weaken it to regain stability:
%\begin{align*}
% 	P 
% 	\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{I} 
%	\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>} \shared{\exsts{v > 0}\cell{x_1}{v} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{I} 
%\end{align*}
%%
%Let $I'' = \{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}$; 
The pre-condition of the \li{slave(x2)} thread can be derived thus:
%
\begin{align}
  \shared{P}{I}
  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
  \shared{P}{\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}}  \tag{1} \label{inc:ass1} \\[-5pt] 
	&\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}} \tag{2} \label{inc:ass2} \\[-5pt] 
	&\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{S'_{x_2}} \tag{3} \label{inc:ass3} \\[-5pt] 
	&\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1} \lor \cell{x_1}{1} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{S'_{x_2}} \tag{4} \label{inc:ass4} \\[-20pt] \nonumber
\end{align}
%

We begin by rewriting the $s_{x_1}$ action of $I$ into the stronger
action of $s'_{x_2}$ as per (\ref{inc:ass1}). This implication
involves subtle interaction between the assertion and the interference
relation of the subjective view. Consider the $s_{x_1}$ action and the
initial state with value $0$ in all the cells. This action can be
replaced by $s'_{x_2}$ because, as the programmer knows, whenever the
value of $x_1$ is greater than $x_2$ by 1, then $x_0$ is also greater
than $x_2$ by 1 (and is equal to $x_0$). As such, rewriting $s_{x_1}$
as $s'_{x_2}$ does not alter its behaviour and merely reflects
stronger knowledge about how $x_2$ and $x_0$ are related through
$x_1$.
%This amended action gives full information about how the resource of the subjective view changes as \li{x} is being updated.
\shiftRule allows us to replace $I$ with any interference relation
$I'$ that has the same observable effect as far as the subjective
assertion $P$ of the subjective view is concerned (written $I
\weakenI{P} I'$). By the informal argument above, $I\weakenI{P}
\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}$, hence we can replace $I$ with
$\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}$.
%

Because subjective views only describe \emph{parts} of the shared
state, we can use the \forgetRule principle to obtain a weaker view of
the shared state, in this case a view that ignores the cells at $x_0$
as well as the previous sibling of $x_1$ as in (\ref{inc:ass2}).
%However, as discussed above (see slave machines) the resulting subjective view is not necessarily stable any longer; and we need to weaken it to regain stability:
%%
%\begin{align*}
% 	\shared{P}{\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}}
% 	\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}} \\[-20pt]
%\end{align*}
%%
%%

Since the resulting subjective view no longer observes the value of
$x_0$, the action $m_{x_0}$ does not have observable effects as it
leaves other cells unchanged. We can thus apply the \shiftRule
principle to rid the interference of $m_{x_0}$ as in
(\ref{inc:ass3}).% \vspace{-5pt}
%%
%\begin{align*}
% 	\shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}}
% 	\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{S'_{x_2}} \\[-20pt]
%\end{align*}
%%

Finally, we stabilise the subjective view with respect to $S'_{x_2}$
and obtain our final precondition of \li{slave(x2)} as per
(\ref{inc:ass4}). \\%\vspace{-5pt}
%%
%\begin{align*}
% 	\shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{\{m_{x_0}, s'_{x_2}, s_{x_2}\}}
% 	\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>} \shared{\cell{x_1}{0} * \cell{x_2}{0, x_1}}{S'_{x_2}} \\[-20pt]
%\end{align*}
%%




The rest of the \li{ring(x)} proof is straightforward. Once all
threads have completed their operations, we join up their
postconditions using the \mergeRule principle, which embodies a
crucial feature of \colosl: different subjective views
\emph{overlap}. Since $|/$ distributes over $**$, the subjective view
simplifies to $\shared{\cell{x_0}{10, x_2} * \cell{x_1}{10, x_0} *
  \cell{x_2}{10, x_1}}{S'_{x_0} \cup S'_{x_1} \cup
  S'_{x_2}}$. Finally, since $S'_{x_0} \cup S'_{x_1} \cup S'_{x_2}$
$\weakenI{\cell{x_0}{10, x_2} * \cell{x_1}{10, x_0} * \cell{x_2}{10,
    x_1}} I $, by the \shiftRule principle, we get the postcondition
of \li{ring(x)}.


%\paragraph{Comparison with other formalisms}
This concludes our \colosl proof of \li{ring(x)}. Our expansion and
contraction of subjective views, in particular with shifting of
interference assertions in key places, enables us to confine the
specification and verification of each thread to just the resources
they need. This is not possible in existing frameworks. Small
specifications make proofs robust against changes to each thread's
environment, and provide more opportunities for proof reuse. For
instance, our proof of the ring straightforwardly generalises to $n$
slave threads, without needing to reprove \li{master} or \li{slave} at
all. Moreover, the proof changes only minimally if the main program is
changed to dynamically grow the ring by spawning more slave threads,
as described in \fig\ref{fig:spawner}. If a thread running
\li{spawn(x)} is added to the parallel composition of \li{ring}, then
the proof of \li{master} has to be modified slightly to include the
possibility for the last node of the ring to change. The proof of
\li{slave} is unchanged.

%This example code is interesting because the threads are intricately intertwined. In the case of the $\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$ thread, the programmer knows that the code depends on the values of variables
%\li{x} and \li{y}  and that it can increment  \li{y} as long as its value is less than that of \li{x}.
%However, she also knows a much more complex behaviour of the thread: given the initial setting where all variables have value $0$, then the thread can only increase the value of \li{y} by $1$ if \li{x} is one more than \li{y},  and the environment can only increase \li{x} by one if \li{x} and \li{z} (and in fact \li{y}) have the same value. Finally, the programmer knows that at the end all the variables will have value $10$. 
%
%\colosl can simply specify this complex behaviour of the resources
%associated with thread $\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$.  Consider the \colosl
%assertions accompanying $\mathbb{INC}$.  After initialisation, line~3
%of $\mathbb{INC}$ provides a standard assertion from separation
%logic~\cite{seplog} with variables as
%resource~\cite{variablesAsResource}. The assertion declares that the
%variable cells addressed by \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} have value
%$0$. This variable resource in the thread-local state is fully owned
%by the thread. Using the \extendRule principle in conjunction with the
%\conseqRule rule, the thread is able to give up this local resource
%and transfer it to the global shared state.
%
%In its general form, the \extendRule adds locally-held resources
%described by $P$ to the shared state, subject to the new interference
%relation $I$, and creates fresh sets of tokens $\token A$, $\token A'$, some
%kept locally and some shared. The side-condition $P\containI I$
%ensures that $I$ cannot modify resource outside of the new extension
%delimited by $P$, in particular preserving any pre-existing subjective
%view of the shared state which otherwise would need to suddenly
%account for new interference in $I$. As will be crucial for the set
%example in \S\ref{sec:examples} (but unimportant here), a novel
%feature of this rule is that actions in $I$ may refer to existing
%shared resources, unlike CAP for example, where all possible futures of the
%region must be accounted for upon its creation. 

%Line~4 demonstrates the creation of a subjective view
%$\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|-> 0 * \li{z}|-> 0}I$ under
%interferences coming from three similar actions. For instance, $a_{\li
%  y}$ can increment \li{y} under the condition that its value is one
%less than \li{x}.  This update can only be carried out by the thread
%that holds the $[\token a_{\li y}]$ \emph{capability} in its local
%state. For this particular example, the assertion in line~4 simply has
%all the capabilities $[\token a_{\li x}] * [\token a_{\li y}] *
%[\token a_{\li z}]$ of the actions of $I$ in the local state; in
%general, capabilities can be buried inside boxes, only to emerge as a
%consequence of an action (see \S\ref{sec:examples}).
%
%This subjective view may then be freely duplicated using the \copyRule
%principle and each thread is given a copy together with the
%appropriate capability using the \parRule rule. For instance, thread
%$\mathbb{P}_{\li y}$ gets
%$
%\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{I} *[\token a_{\li y}]
%$.
%
%However, this precondition is more complicated than we
%need. Intuitively, the specification of each thread should only use
%the variable resource relevant to that thread, and need only consider
%actions that affect that resource. In this example, the extraneous
%piece of state is the variable cell \li{z}. This additional resource
%might seem an acceptable price to pay, but straightforward
%generalisations to $n$ participants yields extra state of $n\!-\!2$
%variable cells with their associated interferences which are of no
%interest to the particular thread.  Fundamentally, for large systems,
%the burden of carrying the whole shared state around to analyse all
%threads can lead to intractable proofs. In our example this would be
%acceptable since the footprint of each thread is small, but in general needlessly
%verbose states require extraneous stability checks at every program
%point.
%
%Because subjective views only describe \emph{parts} of the shared
%state, we can use the \forgetRule principle to obtain a weaker view of
%the shared state, in this case a view that ignores \li{z}. The resulting subjective view is
%not necessarily stable any longer; here we weaken it to regain
%stability:
%%%  The \shiftRule principle allows
%%% us to replace $I$ with any interference relation $I'$ that has the
%%% same observable effect on the subjective assertion $P$ (written $I
%%% \weakenI{P} I'$). Without the \li{z} cell, action $a_{\li z}$ does not
%%% have observable effects since it leaves other cells unchanged. We thus
%%% get:
%\begin{align*}
% 	\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{I} *[\token a_{\li y}]&
%	\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>} \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0}{I} *[\token a_{\li y} ]\\
% 	%% &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{\semimplies}
%        %% \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{I\setminus a_{\small\li z}} *[\token a_{\li y}]\\
%	&\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>}
%        \shared{\exsts{v, v'}  (\li{x}|-> v \!*\! \li{y}|->v' ) \!\land\! v\geq v'}{I} \!\!*[\token a_{\li y}]
%\end{align*}
%%Since the thread owns $[\token{a}_{\li{y}}]$ locally, the environment can't perform its action and thus the subjective view is stable against it. On the other hand, as the environment may hold $[\token{a}_{\li{x}}]$, we should stabilise with respect to its action. 
%However, this assertion is now too weak for our purposes. Indeed, the
%programmer knows that \li{x} can only be incremented when its value is
%equal to \li{z} and \li{y}. However, this is not reflected in
%$a_{\small\li{x}}$. Since we have forgotten the value of \li{z}, it
%could match the value of \li{x} whenever \li{x} is incremented by
%$a_{\small\li{x}}$, hence there is nothing to constrain the increment
%on \li{x} given the values of \li{x} and \li{y}. We can thus only
%stabilise to a weak assertion that loses information about how the
%values of \li{x} and \li{y} are connected together through \li{z}.
%
%
%%It is however possible to give a stronger specification, as follows: \vspace*{-8pt} 
%%%
%%\begin{align*}
%%  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{I} *[\token a_{\small\li y}]
%%  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
%%  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 * \li{z}|-> 0}{\{a_{\small\li x}', a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li z}\}} *[\token a_{\small\li y} ] \vspace*{-5pt}\\
%%  &\stackrel{(\forgetRule)}{=>}
%%  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{\{a_{\small\li x}', a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li z}\}} *[\token a_{\small\li y}]\\
%%  &\stackrel{(\shiftRule)}{=>}
%%  \shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{I_{\small\li y}'} *[\token a_{\small\li y}] \\
%%  &\stackrel{(\weakenRule)}{=>}
%%  \shared{
%%    \begin{array}{@{}l<{\null}@{}l<{\null}@{}}
%%      \cell{\li{x}}{0} * \cell{\li{y}}{0} |/ 
%%      \cell{\li{x}}{1} * \cell{\li{y}}{0}
%%    \end{array}
%%  }{I_{\small\li y}'}
%%  * [\token a_{\small\li y}]\vspace*{-5pt}
%%\end{align*}
%%%
%%This implication involves subtle interaction between the assertion and
%%the interference relation of the subjective view.  Consider the $a_{\small\li x}$ action and the initial state with value $0$ in all the
%%cells. This action can be replaced by $a_{\small\li x}'$ because, as the
%%programmer knows, whenever \li{x} and \li{z} have the same value then
%%\li{y} also has the same value which, under these conditions, is not
%%changed by the actions in $I$.  This amended action reflects stronger
%%knowledge about when \li{x} can be incremented and how its value is
%%related to \li{y} and \li{z}.
%%%This amended action gives full information about how the resource of the subjective view changes as \li{x} is being updated.
%%\shiftRule allows us to replace $I$ with any interference relation
%%$I'$ that has the same observable effect as far as the subjective
%%assertion $P$ of the subjective view is concerned (written $I
%%\weakenI{P} I'$). By the informal argument above,
%%$I\weakenI{\cell{\li{x}}{0} * \cell{\li{y}}{0} * \cell{\li{z}}{0}}
%%\{a'_{\small\li x}, a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li z}\}$, hence we can
%%replace $I$ with $\{a'_{\small\li x}, a_{\small\li y}, a_{\small\li
%%  z}\}$.
%%%
%
%%
%%
%%
%%%The proof of the specification of the thread $\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$ is
%%%now relatively straightforward. By inspection (or using the rules of
%%%\S\ref{subsec:prules}), the invariant of the while loop is stable with
%%%respect to $I_{\small\li y}'$. The atomic section allows safe manipulation
%%%of the contents of the subjective view.  The final postcondition of
%%%$\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$ follows from the invariant and the boolean
%%%expression of the while.
%% We join up the postconditions of the threads
%%using \mergeRule, which embodies a crucial feature of \colosl:

%%$**$, the subjective view simplifies to $\shared{\li{x}|->10 *
%%  \li{y}|->10 * \li{z}|->10}{I_{\small\li x}'\cup I_{\small\li y}'\cup I_{\small\li z}'}
%%$.  Finally, since $ I_{\small\li x}'\cup I_{\small\li y}'\cup I_{\small\li z}'$
%%$\weakenI{\li{x}|->10 * \li{y}|->10 * \li{z}|->10} I $, by the
%%\shiftRule principle, we get the postcondition of $\mathbb{INC}$.
%%
%%
%%%\paragraph{Comparison with other formalisms}
%%This concludes our \colosl proof of $\mathbb{INC}$. Our expansion and
%%contraction of subjective views, in particular with shifting of
%%interference assertions in key places, enables us to confine the
%%specification and verification of each thread to just the resources
%%they need. This is not possible in existing frameworks.
%%
%%
%%We complete our semi-formal overview by noting that unlike
%%CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and as in iCAP~\cite{icap}, we do not provide
%%an explicit \emph{unsharing} mechanism to claim shared
%%resources and render them thread-local. Instead, this behaviour can
%%be simply encoded as an additional action. For instance, in order to
%%remove the \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} variables from the shared state
%%at the end of the $\mathbb{INC}$ program, one can add the following
%%action to all of the above interference assertions ($I$,
%%$I_{\small\li{x}}'$,
%%$I_{\small\li{y}}'$, and $I_{\small\li{z}}'$):
%%%
%%\vspace{-5pt}
%%\[
%%	a_{\textsf{rem}} \eqdef [\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}]: \cell{\li x}{10} * \cell{\li y}{10} * \cell{\li z}{10} \swap [\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]
%%\]
%%%
%
%Only then do we use \forgetRule to lose \li{z} and obtain the
%subjective view  $\shared{\li{x}|-> 0 * \li{y}|->0 }{I_{\small\li
%    y}'}$, as the new action $a_{\small\li x}'$ in $I'_{\small\li y}$
%retains enough information about how \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} are
%related. Without \li{z}, the action $a_{\li z}$ does not
%have observable effects since it leaves other cells unchanged, hence 
%another application of \shiftRule rids us of $a_{\small\li{z}}$.
%The interference relation is now as simple as it can get, whilst retaining enough information about the connection between \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z}. Finally, we stabilise the subjective view with respect to $I_{\small\li y}'$ and obtain our final precondition of $\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$.
%%, which retains much more information about the values of \li{x} and \li{y}. %
%
%%% There is one more subtlety to mention about this precondition. The thread has the capability $[\token a_{\small\li y}]$ to perform its action which only requires the resources described by the subjective view. However, the action $a_{\small\li x}$ depends on \li{z}, which is no longer a part of the subjective view of the thread. Since another thread in the environment may own the $[\token{a_{\small\li x}}]$ capability, it may perform its action whenever its subjective view is {\em compatible} with the pre-condition of the action.
%%% When that is the case, the piece of the state corresponding to the overlap between the state and the
%%% precondition of the action is removed, and the entire postcondition of the action is added in its place.
%%% %Diagrammatically, a subjective state (represented by the circle) is affected as follows by an action $P\swap Q$:\vspace*{-8pt}
%%% %%
%%% %\[
%%% % \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
%%% % \draw[thick] (0,0) circle (.4cm);
%%% % \draw[densely dotted] (0,0) rectangle (.4cm,.6cm);

%%% % \end{tikzpicture}|= Q\right)\vspace*{-5pt}
%%% %\]
%%% %%
%%% This is due to the fact that the subjective view describes the thread's partial knowledge about the shared state, while the environment may have some additional knowledge to what the thread knows. In this case, while the thread does not have the capability to do the action of $[\token a_{\small\li x}]$, the environment might.
%
%The proof of the specification of the thread $\mathbb{P}_{\small\li y}$ is
%now relatively straightforward. By inspection (or using the rules of
%\S\ref{subsec:prules}), the invariant of the while loop is stable with

%$.  Finally, since $ I_{\small\li x}'\cup I_{\small\li y}'\cup I_{\small\li z}'$
%$\weakenI{\li{x}|->10 * \li{y}|->10 * \li{z}|->10} I $, by the
%\shiftRule principle, we get the postcondition of $\mathbb{INC}$.
%
%
%%\paragraph{Comparison with other formalisms}
%This concludes our \colosl proof of $\mathbb{INC}$. Our expansion and
%contraction of subjective views, in particular with shifting of
%interference assertions in key places, enables us to confine the
%specification and verification of each thread to just the resources
%they need. This is not possible in existing frameworks. This tightness
%of specifications makes proofs robust against changes to each thread's
%environment, and provide more opportunities for proof reuse. For
%instance, our proof of the ring straightforwardly generalises to $n$
%slave threads, without needing to reprove \li{master} or \li{thread}
%at all. Moreover, the proof changes only minimally if the main program
%is changed to dynamically grow the ring by spawning more slave
%threads, as described in \fig\ref{fig:spawner}. If a thread running
%\li{spawn(x0)} is added to the parallel composition of \li{ring}, then
%the proof of \li{master} has to be modified slightly to include the
%possibility for the last node of the ring to change. The proof of
%\li{slave} is unchanged.

%% In \S\ref{sec:examples}
%% %Appendix~\ref{sec:mutual-exclusion} 
%% we generalise the mutual exclusion ring presented in this section to
%% $n$ threads and demonstrate how it can be used to guard a shared
%% resource accessed concurrently. In particular, since at each point in
%% time only one thread may perform an action, that thread can be granted
%% the guarded resource exclusively (similarly to holding a lock).

In contrast, the shared state in previous work has to include the
global interference relation. In both of the extensions described
above, this relation would change and the proofs of all threads would
need to be adapted. Moreover, the same issue regarding the
pre-allocation of all future tokens as in \S\ref{subsec:set} applies,
in CAP, tokens for all possible memory locations would have to be
allocated at the time the region is created, to account for all
possible locations where a new counter can be created by \li{spawn}.

We complete our semi-formal overview by noting that unlike
CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10} and as in iCAP~\cite{icap}, we do not provide
an explicit \emph{unsharing} mechanism to claim shared resources and
render them thread-local. Instead, this behaviour can be simply
encoded for a resource described by $P$ and associated with tokens
$\token{a}_1$, \ldots $\token{a}_{n}$ as, e.g., an additional action
of the form
\[
[\token{a}_1] * \cdots * [\token{a}_{n}]{:}\, P \swap [\token{a}_1] * \cdots * [\token{a}_{n}]
\]
That is, a thread holding all the tokens can remove the resource $P$
from the shared state and move them into its local state. In return,
it must transfer the associated capabilities into the shared
state. Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource
transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only
appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from
the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state);
dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$
denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local
state).


%% . For instance, in order to
%% remove the \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} variables from the shared state
%% at the end of the $\mathbb{INC}$ program, one can add the following
%% action to all of the above interference assertions ($I$,
%% $I_{\small\li{x}}'$,
%% $I_{\small\li{y}}'$, and $I_{\small\li{z}}'$):
%% %
%% \vspace{-5pt}
%% \[
%% 	a_{\textsf{rem}} \eqdef [\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}]: \cell{\li x}{10} * \cell{\li y}{10} * \cell{\li z}{10} \swap [\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}] * [\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]
%% \]
%% %
%% That is, when \li{x}, \li{y} and \li{z} all hold value $10$, any thread in possession of all three $[\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{y}}]$, $[\token{a}_{\small\li{z}}]$ capabilities in its local state can carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$. In doing so, the acting thread will remove the three cells from the shared state (and move them into its local state). In return, it must transfer the three locally held capabilities into the shared state. Note that after adding $a_{\textsf{rem}}$, the subjective views of all three threads remain stable since each thread locally holds one of the capabilities in $\{\token{a}_{\small\li{x}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{y}}, \token{a}_{\small\li{z}}\}$ and thus knows that the environment cannot carry out $a_{\textsf{rem}}$ (as it is missing at least one of the required capabilities). Borrowed from CAP~\cite{cap-ecoop10}, this pattern of resource transfer is common in \colosl actions. In general, resources that only appear on the left hand side of $\swap$ indicate their removal from the shared state (and their addition to the thread's local state); dually, resources that only appear on the right hand side of $\swap$ denote their transfer to the shared state (from the thread's local state).

We also note that, as in the CAP family~\cite{cap-ecoop10,icap,tada}, \colosl
cannot ensure that proved programs do not leak memory. Indeed, one may
at any point of a proof stash leaked resources into a new subjective
view, then weaken the resulting assertion to remove that view from the
current state, rendering the leak invisible as far as the proof system
is concerned.
