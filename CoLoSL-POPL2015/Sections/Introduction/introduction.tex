\section{Introduction}

%% Jules: be more general than just program logics? Model-checking, etc.?

Driven by the ever-increasing need for concurrency in software,
%%  spurred by recent hardware developments, 
program logics for shared-memory concurrency have progressed towards
the twin ideals of fine-grain reasoning and compositionality. The
former enables elegant proof techniques about increasingly subtle
concurrency idioms~\cite{vv06popl,vv07msc,todo}, while the latter
allows programs to be proved component-wise and their proofs to be
reusable as-is in any client
program~\cite{csl-tcs,cap-ecoop10,icap}.
%%  Central to these compositional verification frameworks is the
%% formalism used to describe both the state shared between program
%% threads and the possible interference on that state.
%%
%% dating back from Owicki~\cite{owicki}, and later Jones who
%% integrated the notion of interference in the logic
%% itself~\cite{rg}.
%% 
The recent formalism of Views~\cite{views} pinpoints a common
fundamental insight behind these program logics: assertions denote
\emph{views} of the concrete machine state for each thread, which
other threads cannot invalidate. Borrowing the vocabulary, existing
formalisms (with the notable exception of Local Rely
Guarantee~\cite{lrg}--henceforth LRG) require the view of all threads
to map to the same portion of concrete state. This impedes
compositionality: to use a given program specification in another
context, the current shared state has to match that of the existing
specification, instead of merely containing it.  While
compositionality calls for specifications that talk only about the
part of the state actually accessed by each thread (the thread's
\emph{subjective view} of the state), the rigidity of existing
frameworks forces us to adopt global specifications. Moreover, the
reasoning has to be robust against interferences from the environment
\emph{even on parts of the shared state not actually accessed by the
  current thread}. Finally, while in some examples one will know what
the entire global shared state is, this will not always be the case
(\textit{e.g.}, when proving code from a library, independently of any
client). For shared-memory reasoning to naturally apply to incomplete
code and scale to large programs, better techniques are needed.

%% Consider for instance
%% a program where threads operate on subgraphs of a global graph.

This paper presents the program logic \colosl, which achieves
compositional reasoning for concurrent programs by enabling
\emph{subjective} views of the shared state. Subjective views may be
composed arbitrarily and manipulated so as to retain only the portions
of local and shared state actually accessed by each thread in the
program, and to consider only the interferences relevant to that piece
of shared state. \colosl achieves a greater degree of compositionality
than existing work by enabling \emph{finer-grained} sharing: the
program logic can consider that threads share only what is relevant to
their function, a key ingredient of compositionality.

%%  dubbed their \emph{subjective states}.  One may then reuse these
%%   specifications in the context of any larger local state (as is
%%   standard in separation logic~\cite{rey02}), and, crucially for
%%   compositional reasoning about concurrent programs, any larger
%%   shared state. The subjective states of different threads in a
%%   program are allowed to overlap arbitrarily, ensuring maximum
%%   reusability of proofs.

\colosl's subjective views are of the form $\shared P I$ where $P$ is
a formula and $I$ is the \emph{interference} described as a set of \emph{actions}. The  $\shared P I$ assertion means that the formula $P$ is true of \emph{some part} of the shared state, and that this part of the shared state is subject to the interference captured by $I$. The interference $I$ contains actions that describe how the shared state can be mutated by the environment (known in the literature as ``Rely''), as well as those actions that the current thread is allowed to perform (known as ``Guarantee'').  Four novel principles allow us to reason about this novel interpretation of shared state assertions in \colosl.

First, subjective views only capture fractions of the global shared
state relevant to the program at hand, and we can always zoom in
further on the subjective state:
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:forget}
  \shared{P * Q}{I} &=> \shared{P}{I}  \tag{\forgetRule}
\end{align*}
This allows one to reuse specifications written from a subjective view
of the state in contexts where we know more about the share state.

Second, the $*$ connective of separation logic combines
subjective views by \emph{overlapping} them ($P ** Q$ denotes those
states that result from overlapping a state satisfying $P$ with one
satisfying $Q$):
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:merge}
  \shared{P}{I_1} * \shared{Q}{I_2} &=> \shared{P \sepish Q}{I_1 \cup I_2} \tag{\mergeRule}
\end{align*}
Doing so also combines the interference relations. Pleasingly, the new
interference relation is simply the union of previous interferences.
Similarly, the subjective view can always be duplicated:
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:split}
  \shared{P}{I} &=> \shared{P}{I} * \shared P I \tag{\copyRule}
\end{align*}
In combination with the usual law of parallel composition of
separation logic~\cite{csl-tcs}, this yields a powerful mechanism to
distribute the shared state between several threads:
\[
\infrule{Parallel}
        {\hoare{P_1}{\mathbb{P}_1}{Q_1}\\
          \hoare{P_2}{\mathbb{P}_2}{Q_2}}
        {\hoare{P_1 * P_2}{\mathbb{P}_1 || \mathbb{P}_2}{Q_1 * Q_2}}
        {}
\]


Third, a set of actions $I$ can be exchanged for any other $I'$ that
has the same projected effect on the subjective state $P$; when that
is the case, we write $ I \weakenIb{P} I'$ and say that the actions
are \emph{shifted}:
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:shift}
  I \weakenIb{P} I'
  &\text{ implies }
  \shared{P}{I} ===> \shared{P}{I'}
  \tag{\shiftRule}
\end{align*}
This feature is in contrast with most existing formalisms, where the
interference relation is fixed for the proof of the whole program. The
semantic relation $\weakenIb{}$ is partially axiomitised so as to
reduce shifting proofs to simple logical entailments. While
incomplete, we found this axiomatisation to be enough for our
examples.

Finally, private resources can be incorporated into the shared state
together with new actions:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:extend}
  P \containI I
  &\text{ implies }
  P ===>
  \exsts{\capAss{1}, \capAss{2}} \capAss{1} * \shared{P *
    \capAss{2}}{I}
  \tag{\extendRule}
\end{align}
The side condition $P \containI I$ ensures that the mutations
performed by actions in $I$ are confined to $P$. The existential
quantification of capabilities is to ensure the \emph{freshness} of
the generated capabilities. The main novelty of this rule is the fact
that new actions may refer to existing shared state. As we will see in
our example of concurrent set operations, this enable flexible and
powerful reasoning.
\azaleacomment{We have not said what capabilities are. This is a bit rushed. Also, are we going to replace $\capAss{}$ with tokens?}
Contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  We introduce the program logic \colosl, which achieves fully
  compositional rely/guarantee style reasoning for concurrent
  programs. Our soundness result is parametric in the underlying
  programming language and separation algebra of states. The four
  principles above are simple semantic consequences of our generic
  model of program states.
\item
  new features: merge, extend, and shift. Or perhaps include that in
  related work instead.
\item
  Our capability model is slightly more flexible than previous
  work~\cite{cap-ecoop10,tada}. (TODO: make a real sentence and
  incorporate this to another item, unless we make it a full
  contribution)
\item
  We evaluate \colosl on a range of key examples that were challenging
  for previous work. We are able to derive natural and concise specs,
  circumscribed to the part of the shared state accessed by each
  thread, even in the case of threads operating on subparts of data
  structures with unspecified sharing (directed graphs in our
  example).
\item
  We demonstrate the generality of \colosl by deriving the main
  reasoning principles of existing program logics for concurrency
  within our framework.

Reasoning about concurrency: major advances since Owicki-Gries:
compositional reasoning, from the seminal paper by Jones~\cite{rg} on
the one hand, and O'Hearn~\cite{csl-orig,csl-tcs} on the other hand,
later fused together in a series of increasingly compositional
formalisms such as RGSep~\cite{viktor-marriage}, Local RG~\cite{lrg},
deny-guarantee~\cite{dg}, and the CAP
family~\cite{cap-ecoop10,icap,tada}, to name a few.

%% [have pictures of the shared state throughout the ages, like in the
%%   York talk? No: it's difficult to argue that the drawings accurately
%%   represent the logics RGSep and LRG...]

In some way, this mirrors the progression w.r.t.\ compositionality of
reasoning about sequential programs with resources/heap: first Hoare
logic~\cite{hoarelogic} carry around the whole of the heap. Major
advances in compositionality for pointer programs via separation
logic~\cite{seplog}, which enables \emph{local} proofs where
irrelevant and disjoint pieces of state are \emph{framed}, recently
extended to programs manipulating data structures with intrinsic
sharing, such as graphs~\cite{ramification}.
