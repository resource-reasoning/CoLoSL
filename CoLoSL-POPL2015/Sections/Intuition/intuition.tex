Consider the program in \fig\ref{fig:concurrentInc} and let us assume that the program variables x, y and z are initialised with value $0$ at the beginning. Three threads $\tau_X, \tau_Y$ and $\tau_Z$ are spawned to increment their values in lock-step such that at any point, the values of any two variables are offset by at most 1. Since initially x=z=$0$, the if statement of the first thread is successful and thus the value of x is incremented. The effect is then cascaded down to the other threads and subsequently the values of y and z are incremented. At this point since once again x = z, the first thread takes over and the same process repeats until x = y = z = $100$. Since the program executed by each thread depends on the value of the variable at hand as well as the value of the variable that comes before it in the $x, y, z$ chain, the values of these variable must be \emph{shared} such that each thread has access to the required variables.

We would like to reason about this example and establish that if the program does terminate, the final values of all three variables are $100$.
