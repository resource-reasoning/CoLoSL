\begin{abstract}
A key difficulty in verifying shared-memory concurrent programs is
reasoning compositionally about each thread in isolation, even though
in reality the correctness of the whole system is the collaborative
result of intricately intertwined actions of the threads.  Such
compositionality is essential for verifying large concurrent systems
and replicating a programmer's intuition about why their
implementations are correct. For sequential programs, separation logic
has demonstrated the importance of reasoning only about portions of
the machine state (the resource) actually accessed by programs. For
concurrent programs, existing techniques require global reasoning
about shared resource, even though a thread might only access a small
part of it.

This paper introduces the program logic \colosl, in which threads are
verified with respect to their \emph{subjective views}. Each
subjective (personalised) view provides a thread-specific description
of the shared state, comprising the partial shared resource necessary
for the thread to run and a thread-specific interference relation
describing how the thread and the environment can effect this partial
shared resource. Subjective views may arbitrarily overlap with each
other.  In particular, the interference relations expand and contract
with relation to the partial shared resource, as long as the projected
effect on the subjective view remains the same.  This flexibility
provides truly compositional proofs for shared-memory concurrency,
which we demonstrate on a range of examples including a concurrent
computation of the spanning tree of a graph.
