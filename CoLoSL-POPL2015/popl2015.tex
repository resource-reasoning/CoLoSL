\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A key difficulty in verifying shared-memory concurrent programs is
reasoning compositionally about each thread in isolation. Existing
verification techniques for fine-grained concurrency require 
reasoning about static global shared resource, impeding compositionality.  This
paper introduces the program logic \colosl, in which each thread is
verified with respect to its flexible subjective view of the global
shared state.
This subjective view  just describes  that part of the global shared resource accessed by the
thread. Subjective views may arbitrarily overlap with each other, and
expand and contract depending on the resource required by the thread.
This flexibility provides truly compositional proofs for shared-memory
concurrency, which we demonstrate on a range of examples including a
concurrent computation of a spanning tree of a graph.
