## Reviewer B is concerned about the overall approach

Our main contribution is to provide a flexible framing mechanism for
the shared resource and its interference. In the same way that
sequential separation logic improved on Hoare logic by providing a way
to frame off unnecessary resource, recent concurrent program logics
such as CAP and its variants provided a framing mechanism on the
shared resource. However, this framing on the shared resource is
restrictive: we can frame off whole regions at a time but not
arbitrary parts of each region. This framing is also too static: we
must predetermine the regions before the reasoning has started. As
Reviewer A points out, this results in awkward proofs as in the CAP
proof of the set example (section 4.2).  In contrast, with CoLoSL we
can frame off arbitrary overlapping parts of the shared resource.  In
addition, CoLoSL is the first logic to provide a *framing/rewriting*
mechanism on the interference: framing off irrelevant actions
simplifies the stability checks; rewriting actions allows the
combination of the knowledge of global invariants with actions and
thus obtain a stronger subjective view. Perhaps more fundamentally,
these mechanisms allow for fully compositional reasoning, discussed
below. 


## Reviewers B and C comment on the complexity of CoLoSL

Reasoning about fine-grained concurrent programs is hard.  We believe
that a lot of the perceived complexity of CoLoSL can be attributed to
the difficulty associated with reasoning about fine-grained concurrent
programs in general. Existing logics such as CAP, CaReSL and iCAP are
also quite complex, although getting significantly better over time.
With CoLoSL, we can achieve CAP-style reasoning with the same level of
complexity as the modern simplified CAP-style logics. However, we can
also give more compositional specifications using our unrestricted
framing on shared state. In particular, CoLoSL can be used to prove
the simple, global spec of INC; the novel contribution is in the tight
local spec of INC and its proof.  We have introduced new reasoning
principles such as SHIFT and EXTEND, which we believe are conceptually
natural but we do agree are difficult to describe formally. We have
tried to minimise the complexity of proof obligations by reducing them
to separation logic entailments. We will think about this carefully
for a  final draft.

Concurrent reasoning about overlapping data structures is even harder.
When verifying a large system (100,000+ lines of code), distinct
portions of the code will care about different sets of shared data
structures. Moreover, these data structures can overlap, for instance
the sub-graphs of a larger graph (as in the spanning tree example), or
even collections of discrete memory cells (as in INC). In existing
work, the verification often has to resort to being non-compositional,
verifying all procedures with respect to the whole shared
state. Worse, this shared state can only be found by analysing the
whole code. We believe that CoLoSL lays the foundations to make the
goal of verifying large concurrent programs attainable: it allows
local proofs to be stitched together regardless of the part of the
shared state they consider individually, as demonstrated on our small
(but, as noted by Reviewer C, very challenging) examples.


## Reviewer B highlights three more questions.

1) “Can something similar be done for the proof of Sec 4.1?”. 

We do not know how to do the concurrent spanning tree in e.g. CAP, so
cannot make an analogous strong comparison as with the set example. We
did try.  It probably is possible to do something in CAP.  However,
our initial explorations show that this would be very complicated.
None of the existing approaches allow for arbitrary unknown sharing
(overlaps) over concurrently accessed resources, as is the case in the
graph algorithm.

Surprisingly, our proof of the concurrent spanning tree example is
simpler than the sequential spanning tree example of [10]. ([10]
proves functional correctness which is not the focus of this paper,
but a direct comparison of comparable proofs demonstrates that our
reasoning is simpler).  Indeed, reviewer B points out that `even
sequential proofs about graph algorithms are rather tricky'. We can
make this comparison clearer.

2) “The introduction mentions `modularity of specifications’… ?”

We do demonstrate the modularity of specifications and proof reuse
through our examples.

We achieve modularity in CoLoSL by *localising* the assertions and
proofs by means of shrinking/expanding subjective views to closely
match the footprint of the algorithms and the intuition of the
programmer. For instance, in the concurrent spanning tree example
(Section 4.1), we localise the footprint of span(x) to g(x, gamma) and
*re-use* the same specification at the recursive call points. Such
re-use of reasoning is natural for recursive functions. Such reasoning
is possible with CoLoSL, due to the flexible framing for the dynamic
overlapping shared resource. Such reasoning is not possible with
e.g. CAP, due to the limited framing for the pre-determined static
shared regions.  

We also demonstrate modularity with the INC example of section 2.
Consider the general case of n threads and variables x_1, ..., x_n in
the token ring. With CoLoSL, the assertion of a subjective view of
thread i (the pre-condition) can be localised to the variables x_i and
x_(i-1). The interference of the subjective view can be localised to
the variables x_i, x_(i-1) and x_(i-2): the interference of the thread
just uses x_i and x_(i-1); the interference of the environment
requires the x_(i-2). With this localised view of the thread, the
stability checks for the assertion are much simpler. Moreover,
reasoning about the thread is independent of the value of n.  With
existing approaches (e.g. CAP), we have emphasised that the
individual thread specifications must be weaker. In addition, the
specifications must be parameterised by this thread count n. Proving a
CAP specification for arbitrary values of n is possible. However, the
CoLoSL approach is more modular in that it is independent of the value
of n. We can make this point clearer.

3) “The model that gives semantics to CoLoSL is abstract … ?”

There has been some confusion. The concrete model is the standard heap
and the concurrent operational semantics is the one used in the views
framework [5]. This paper provides a general soundness result (a
real-world safety property) based on some initial parameters
(including a reification function that relates abstract logical states
to concrete machine states) and some lemmas. We give these parameters,
including the reification function, and prove these lemmas, thus
obtaining a real-world safety property from Theorem 1 in [16]. We will
clarify this point. 


## Reviewer C asks about automation prospects.

In this paper we are challenging the basic assumptions of several
existing concurrent program logics. Automated reasoning in CoLoSL is
an interesting, if premature, research topic. The CAP program logic
was published in 2010 and currently there is no automated tool,
although we know of two groups actively working on this. More
generally, tractable automatic verification of concurrent programs is
still a largely open problem.  We believe our work lays some solid
foundations for automation, in particular because it's
compositional. Our semantic conditions already reduce to separation
logic entailment checks. Moreover, although it is too early to include
in the paper, we have obtained encouraging preliminary results about
reducing entailments with \*/ and --(*) to entailments without these
connectives. This is in the style of how RGSep eliminates --(*), which
has been used in the Smallfoot-RG automatic prover for RGSep.



We thank Reviewer A for their positive feedback. We would like to
address their comments/questions for completeness.

## Reviewer A comments about related work and technical points.

We will expand our related work section to compare CoLoSL with [20]
and other style of logics that use transition systems [Nanevski et
al., ESOP'14]. Our arguments in favour of the strengths and novelty of
CoLoSL in comparison to CAP (and its variants) apply to [20, Nanevski
et al., ESOP’14] as well and we believe that our insights about proof
structure can be carried over to these logics too, although the
precise mechanism as to how is a matter for future work.
The soundness of the EXTEND principle is indeed achieved by the
fencing constraint relating P to I. We will take the reviewer’s advice
and explain this more clearly. We will also elaborate on the intuitive
meaning of both fencing judgements (white and shaded triangles) and
compare them. We will expand the lock-coupling example section by
promoting some of the detailed proofs and description available in the
appendix to the main text.

>>>> “Fig 1: shouldn’t you have some restrictions on A and A’? ...”

In the case of sets of tokens, no further restrictions are needed. In
general, there is a requirement that A and A' can always be picked
"fresh" w.r.t. pre-existing capabilities. This is detailed in the
technical report [16].

>>>> ”AMod seems to map sets of tokens to sets of actions...” 

The INC example features the a_rem action, which requires all three
tokens {a_x, a_y, a_z} at once. At a higher level, the reason why we
consider sets of tokens is because this generalises to other
capability domains easily.


>>>> “Section 4.1. Why do you need  the global graph predicate at all? ...”

The local predicate is indeed sufficient for the proof. We presented
the global predicate to demonstrate that it is possible to derive a
local specification from the global one using the CoLoSL principles.


>>>>  “Fig 6: should you have a usual star in between (U \/ M) and G(l, gamma) in G(x, gamma)? ”

No, since graphs allow loops/cycles, G(x, gamma) and its left subgraph
G(l, gamma) may overlap. For instance, in the graph of Fig 6a. had we
used * rather than \*/ we would have

  G(y, gamma) = y |-> - ... * G(y, gamma) * G(z, gamma) = false

and thus

  graph(x, gamma) = \box{... * false} = false

This is no longer the problem in the local definition g(x, gamma)
since the star-separated subgraphs (g(x, gamma) and g(l, gamma)) are
boxed assertions. Similar to above, we would have:

  g(y, gamma) = \box{y |-> - ... * g(y, gamma) * g(z, gamma)} = 
  \box{y |-> - ...} * \box{g(y, gamma)} * \box{g(z, gamma)} =>
  \box{y |-> - ... \*/ g(y, gamma) \*/ g(z, gamma)}

In a nutshell, the contents of *-separated boxed assertions may
overlap since by the (MERGE) principle

  \box{P}_I * \box{Q}_I' =>  \box{P \*/ Q}_{I \cup I'} 

But *-separated unboxed assertions amount to false when overlapping
(as in ordinary separation logic): y |-> - * y |-> - => false.
