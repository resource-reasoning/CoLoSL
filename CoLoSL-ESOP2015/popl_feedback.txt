Section 2
---------

In this regard, I also find the concurrent increment example presented
in Section 2 to be rather unfortunate as a motivating example.  The
authors seem to want to use the example to motivate why subjective
views enable more scalable proofs, writing: "In this example, the
extraneous piece of state is the variable cell z.  This additional
resource might seem an acceptable price to pay, but straightforward
generalisations to n participants [from 3] yields extra state of n-2
variable cells with their associated interferences which are of no
interest to the particular thread.  Fundamentally, for large systems,
the burden of carrying the whole shared state around to analyse all
threads, can lead to intractable proofs."

This is simply not true, at least as it pertains to this example.  It
is straightforward to prove this concurrent increment example in
existing logics using a global protocol on the n counters, and scaling
a protocol on 3 counters to n counters is very easy (because the
protocol is completely regular).  In fact, one could argue that the
proof for 3 counters already demonstrates all the complexity required
for the one for n counters because the proof for 3 counters already
includes the two special cases for the leftmost and rightmost threads
("x" and "z"), and adding additional counters will just mean there are
n-2 threads whose proofs are identical to the one for the middle "y"
thread.  I expect the authors' proof of the example for 3 threads
would generalize to n threads in exactly the same way.

I did not get a clear sense of what one has to
show in the Shift steps.  I also could not make any sense of the
paragraph that starts "There is one more subtlety."  In one part, it
says, "When that is the case, the piece of the state...is removed" and
I had no idea if what that means logically speaking, or if that is
something that happens in the model when some proof step happens.

More generally, I think it's great to have an informal overview of a
proof like this up front, but then you should come back to this
example later on and walk through the proof of the interesting steps
(like the Shift steps) in more detail.


Section 3
---------

- End of Section 3: "Note that, while sometimes subtle, our semantic
conditions are often easy to check in practice. Actions are usually
small and typically only concern a few cells at a time. Indeed, they
are the by-products of atomic sections in program, which are also kept
small."  This needs to be expanded upon!  How do you check these semantic
conditions?  Please make this clear.  Also, it is funny to talk about
what happens "in practice" concerning a brand new logic!
